# Quality Synonyms Mapping - Phase 1 (High Confidence Only)
#
# Maps canonical quality slugs to their synonym terms
# Used for redirect generation and graph data consolidation
#
# Format: canonical-slug: [synonym1-slug, synonym2-slug, ...]
#
# PHASE 1: Only includes synonyms with explicit mentions in existing quality files
# - time-to-market: "Synonym: Speed-to-Market" in time-to-market.md
# - performance: "this is a duplicate" in performance-efficiency.md
# - availability: "Synonym for availability" in high-availability.md
# - changeability: "Synonym: Mutability" in changeability.md
#
# Future phases may add more synonyms after validation and user feedback.

# Time-related (both files explicitly call each other synonyms)

  - speed-to-market

# Performance (performance-efficiency file says it's a duplicate)
performance:
  - performance-efficiency

# Availability (high-availability file says "synonym for availability")
