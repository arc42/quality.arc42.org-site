#### Stimulus

A developer has created a new test case in xml.

#### Reaction

The code generator creates a source code file.

#### Metric

A human tester can understand the generated test and enhance it with additional tests or test-data within max 30 minutes. 

#### Background

Test cases for a system are described in a (semi-)formal xml-based language and automatically converted into Java, Kotlin or Groovy source code. This code is later adjusted or enhanced by developers or testers.
