#### Stimulus

User has (accidentally) started a report generation, but now wants to interrupt and clicks the `abort` or `cancel` button or select the cancel-function via keyboard.

#### Reaction

The system interrupts the report generation, saves the current generation state (in case user wants to continue later) and returns control to the user interface. 

#### Metric

User gets back full keyboard or mouse control within at most 10 seconds. That means that all backend generation tasks or processes have acknowledged the abort/cancel signal.

#### Background

The generation of such reports is performed in several parallel threads or processes, eventually on different OS-processes, virtual machines or containers. Cancelling or aborting needs to handle such kind of distributed execution.
