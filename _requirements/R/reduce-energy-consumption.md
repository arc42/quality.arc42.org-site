<div class="quality-requirement" markdown="1">
#### Stimulus

The software system is in operation, serving a high number of concurrent users in a data center powered by non-renewable energy sources.

#### Environment

High demand for data processing and computational resources, typical of a large-scale application.

#### Response

The system should prioritize energy efficiency and carbon reduction in its operations. 
It should be designed to:

* optimize energy consumption, aiming to reduce overall energy usage by 25% compared to the previous year's energy consumption. 
* incorporate renewable energy sources for its data center operations, striving to achieve at least 50% of renewable energy usage within the next two years.
* achieve at least 50% of renewable energy usage within the next two years. This goal promotes a gradual shift towards more sustainable energy practices.
