#### Stimulus

A user selects a graphical filter (like shadow, greyscaling, resizing or similar) and clicks or selects the `apply filter` function. 

#### Reaction

The system displays the changed image next to the original upon.

#### Metric

The system displays the changed image in less than a second.

#### Background

We develop an image manipulation software, offering a variety of image filters for users to select and apply to their images. Such filters include shadows, greyscaling, resizing, background-removal and others.

To achieve the required response time, it's an option to reduce the resolution of the image for the preview.
