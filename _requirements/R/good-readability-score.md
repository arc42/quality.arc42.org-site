#### Background

We use the [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/open-source-editions/) to obtain several kinds of metrics on the system.

All source code requires a [SonarQube cognitive complexity](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/cognitive-complexity-because-testability-understandability/) score of 15 or lower.

(See their [whitepaper](https://www.sonarsource.com/resources/cognitive-complexity/) for details)
