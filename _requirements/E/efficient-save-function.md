#### Stimulus

A user uses the web interface to add article to the shopping cart.

#### Reaction

The system displays a confirmation, i.e. an article counter above the shopping cart icon is incremented, once the article has been added reliably to the cart.

#### Metric

The time between hitting the add article button and the displayed confirmation is less than 1 second in 99% of the tests.
