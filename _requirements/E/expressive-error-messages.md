#### Stimulus

An error / exceptional situation occurs in the technical infrastructure (memory overflow, out-of-memory, hardware error, virtual-machine-issue, container-related-issue).

#### Reaction

The system detects the error, reports (as far as possible) to the user and shuts down in a controlled manner. The message shall contain specific explanations and instructions on possible reactions. 

#### Metric

Error detection occurs within 15 seconds, message to user (if still possible) within 1 second, shutdown within 15 seconds.


#### Background

If an error situation occurs, this is displayed to the user in expressive, meaningful messages.
