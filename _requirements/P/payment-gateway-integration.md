#### Context/Background

The e-commerce platform must support multiple payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, Square, etc.) without requiring core system changes for each new integration.

#### Metric/Acceptance Criteria

* Implement a standardized payment interface with well-defined contracts for authorization, capture, refund, and webhook operations.
* New payment gateway integration requires ≤40 hours of development time, including testing and documentation.
* Integration uses configuration-driven approach: new gateways added via config files without code changes to core payment logic.
* All payment gateways support the same error handling patterns and return standardized response formats (success/failure codes, transaction IDs, error messages).
* Versioning & deprecation: semantic versioning for the payment API; deprecation policy with ≥6 months overlap and explicit changelogs/migration guides.
* Contracts: publish OpenAPI/JSON Schema for requests/responses; provide a mock server and contract tests executed in CI for each gateway.
* Webhooks: HMAC‑signed webhooks with shared secret; define signature header, hashing algorithm, replay protection, and tolerated clock skew (e.g., ±5 minutes); webhook retry/backoff policy documented.
* Idempotency: require idempotency keys for POST operations; define behavior for duplicate keys and error semantics (e.g., 409 conflict, 422 validation).
* Observability: per‑gateway p95/p99 latency, success/error taxonomy (timeouts, 5xx, validation), and webhook delivery success rate exposed to dashboards.
* Provide comprehensive integration documentation with code examples, API specifications, example payloads, error code catalog, sequence diagrams, and guidance for rotating test credentials.
* Support sandbox/testing environments for all integrated gateways with automated test suites covering happy path and error scenarios.
* Integration health checks and monitoring endpoints available for each gateway, with standardized metrics (response time, success rate, error types).
* Compliance: payment data handled via tokenization; minimize PCI DSS scope (no PAN storage in core systems).

#### Verification
1. Contract tests pass against mock and sandbox for each gateway; CI enforces schema compatibility.
2. New gateway added via config only; end‑to‑end auth→capture→refund flow succeeds in sandbox within 40h effort.
3. Webhook signature verification, retry/backoff, and idempotency behavior validated with replay/duplicate scenarios.
