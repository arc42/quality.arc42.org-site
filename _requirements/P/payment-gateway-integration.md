#### Context/Background

The e-commerce platform must support multiple payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, Square, etc.) without requiring core system changes for each new integration.

#### Metric/Acceptance Criteria

* Implement a standardized payment interface with well-defined contracts for authorization, capture, refund, and webhook operations.
* New payment gateway integration requires â‰¤40 hours of development time, including testing and documentation.
* Integration uses configuration-driven approach: new gateways added via config files without code changes to core payment logic.
* All payment gateways support the same error handling patterns and return standardized response formats (success/failure codes, transaction IDs, error messages).
* Provide comprehensive integration documentation with code examples, API specifications, and troubleshooting guides for each supported gateway.
* Support sandbox/testing environments for all integrated gateways with automated test suites covering happy path and error scenarios.
* Integration health checks and monitoring endpoints available for each gateway, with standardized metrics (response time, success rate, error types).
