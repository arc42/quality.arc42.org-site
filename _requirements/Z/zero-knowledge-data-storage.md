#### Background

The system offers storage capacity for user-files, similar to services like Dropbox or OneDrive.

#### Scenario

The system has zero knowledge of the content of user files. 
This means that neither the system nor its admins own the encryption keys of user files and therefore can't access them.

It implies that if a user loses the encryption key, data **cannot be recovered**.
