#### Context/Background

Employees in companies often have a central username/password pair or certificate used to log in via a Single Sign On (SSO) solution, such that they do not have to maintain different credentials per system. If a new system is added to the company's portfolio, it should make use of the centralized authentication system.

#### Source

User authenticates using their SSO credentials on the expert system.

#### Metric/Acceptance Criteria

System performs transparently the login via SSO in less than 3 seconds. The user has their correct role and rights after login.
