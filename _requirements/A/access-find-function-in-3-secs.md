#### Context/Background

The system is a software application with a graphical user interface, accessible via mobile or desktop platforms.
The application includes various functions, with the "find" function being a critical feature for locating specific types of data within the system.

#### Source

User interaction - A user accesses the find function from the application's main interface.

#### Metric/Acceptance Criteria

The "find" function must be accessible to users within 3 seconds of the interface loading.
This can be measured by:
*. Time from interface load completion to the "find" function becoming interactive and ready for use.
*. Success rate: At least 99% of users should be able to access the "find" function within the 3-second timeframe.
*. Consistency: This performance metric should be maintained across different devices and network conditions typical for the application's intended use.
