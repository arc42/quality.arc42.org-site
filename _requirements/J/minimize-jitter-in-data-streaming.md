#### Overall Goal
Reduce and control [jitter](/qualities/jitter) in the real-time streaming of data.


#### Stimulus

Continuous transmission of real-time data (from sensors) over a network.

#### Environment

Operational phase under standard network conditions.

#### Response

The system handles variations in delay of data packet delivery.

#### Response Measure

* The variance in delay between data packets (jitter) should not exceed 5 milliseconds for 95% of the transmitted packets
* In instances where jitter exceeds this threshold, the system should employ buffering mechanisms to smooth the data flow, ensuring that the effective jitter experienced by the end-user remains below 7 milliseconds
* The system must detect and log instances of high jitter (above 5 milliseconds) in real-time, triggering alerts for the technical team when such instances exceed 5% of the total packets in any 10-minute window
* During peak load times, the allowable jitter can increase to a maximum of 10 milliseconds, but such instances should not exceed 2% of the total packets transmitted in a 24-hour period.
