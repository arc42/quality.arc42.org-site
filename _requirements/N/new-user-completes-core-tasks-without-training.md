#### Context

An enterprise ERP system is rolled out to employees across finance, procurement, and HR departments.
Users have domain expertise (e.g., accountants understand invoices) but receive no system-specific training before their first session.
The organisation cannot afford extended training programmes; the software must be self-explanatory to domain-knowledgeable users.

#### Trigger

A new user with relevant domain knowledge (e.g., certified accountant, experienced buyer) logs into the ERP for the first time, with no prior demo, tutorial, or instructor-led training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- In a moderated usability test with **≥ 12 first-time users**, **≥ 80% complete all 5 predefined core tasks** (create purchase order, approve invoice, submit expense claim, generate monthly cost-centre report, update supplier record) **within 30 minutes total**, using only in-application guidance
- The **task success rate** (fully correct completion without facilitator intervention) is **≥ 75% per individual task** across test participants
- **No core task requires more than 7 sequential screen interactions** (clicks, form fields, confirmations) to complete on the happy path
- When a user makes an input error, the system surfaces a **contextual, actionable error message within 1 second**; no error message references internal system codes or technical jargon
- After the test session, **≥ 70% of participants** rate the system with a **System Usability Scale (SUS) score of ≥ 68** (the industry-accepted "above average" threshold)
- The in-application help system answers the **top-20 most common first-day questions** (as determined by support-ticket analysis of comparable ERP deployments) without requiring external documentation or internet access
