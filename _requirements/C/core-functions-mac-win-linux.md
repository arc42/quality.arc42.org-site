#### Context

The system offers complicated core business functions and is available on different operating systems, especially macOS, Windows, and major Linux distributions.

#### Trigger

A new release of one of the supported operating systems becomes available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- New OS release does not affect ability to work on the platform in comparable execution environments (CPU and memory capacity)
- Core functions can be re-used on macOS, Windows, and Linux applications without source code changes
