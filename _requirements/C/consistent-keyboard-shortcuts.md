#### Context

The system provides keyboard shortcuts to select and execute functions within the graphical user interface, supporting keyboard-only navigation across all parts of the interface.

#### Trigger

A user navigates the graphical interface using only a keyboard, without a mouse or trackpad.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- User can perform all actions with keyboard alone
- Keyboard shortcuts are consistent throughout the system
- Identical or similar functions (save, copy, paste) have identical shortcuts across the entire system
