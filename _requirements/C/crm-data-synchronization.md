#### Context/Background

The customer support system must integrate with existing CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics) to maintain synchronized customer data and interaction history.

#### Metric/Acceptance Criteria

* Implement standardized data mapping layer that transforms between internal data model and CRM-specific schemas without custom code for each CRM.
* Support both real-time (webhook/API) and batch synchronization modes with configurable sync intervals (1min to 24hrs).
* Data synchronization completes within 5 minutes for incremental updates and 2 hours for full data refresh across all supported CRMs.
* Provide conflict resolution strategies (last-write-wins, field-level merging, manual review queue) configurable per CRM and data type.
* Integration handles authentication (OAuth 2.0, API keys) and rate limiting automatically with exponential backoff and retry logic; retries feed a dead‑letter queue (DLQ) after max attempts.
* Maintain audit trail of all sync operations with detailed logs: timestamp, data changed, source system, success/failure status, error details.
* Support field mapping configuration via UI or config files: map internal fields to CRM fields without code changes.
* Validate data integrity with automated checks: required fields, data type validation, referential integrity across systems.
* Idempotent upserts and deduplication: every record has a stable key; replays do not create duplicates across CRMs.
* Reconciliation: produce a bidirectional reconciliation report daily; alert when drift exceeds thresholds (e.g., >0.5% records diverged) and provide a remediation workflow.
* RPO/RTO: recovery point objective ≤ 15 minutes for incremental sync; recovery time objective ≤ 30 minutes for resuming normal sync after incident.
* Schema evolution: document mapping versioning; unknown fields are ignored by default and logged; mapping changes are backward compatible or gated by feature flags.
* Privacy/Governance: PII processing follows consent and retention policies; encrypt sensitive fields in transit and at rest; redact PII in logs; define data retention for audit logs.
* Observability: per‑CRM throughput, sync lag, error taxonomy, and queue depth metrics; SLO alerts on lag and error rates.
* Scale assumptions: specify expected entities/hour and typical/max payload sizes to validate the SLOs in test and staging.

#### Verification
1. Replay tests confirm idempotent upserts and deduplication across CRMs.
2. Chaos tests (rate‑limit bursts, auth expiry) drain through retries and DLQ without data loss; RPO/RTO targets met.
3. Reconciliation job detects and repairs seeded drift within policy; observability dashboards display throughput, lag, and error taxonomy per CRM.
