#### Context/Background

The customer support system must integrate with existing CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics) to maintain synchronized customer data and interaction history.

#### Metric/Acceptance Criteria

* Implement standardized data mapping layer that transforms between internal data model and CRM-specific schemas without custom code for each CRM.
* Support both real-time (webhook/API) and batch synchronization modes with configurable sync intervals (1min to 24hrs).
* Data synchronization completes within 5 minutes for incremental updates and 2 hours for full data refresh across all supported CRMs.
* Provide conflict resolution strategies (last-write-wins, field-level merging, manual review queue) configurable per CRM and data type.
* Integration handles authentication (OAuth 2.0, API keys) and rate limiting automatically with exponential backoff and retry logic.
* Maintain audit trail of all sync operations with detailed logs: timestamp, data changed, source system, success/failure status, error details.
* Support field mapping configuration via UI or config files: map internal fields to CRM fields without code changes.
* Validate data integrity with automated checks: required fields, data type validation, referential integrity across systems.
