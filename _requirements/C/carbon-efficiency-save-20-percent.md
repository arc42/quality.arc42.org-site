#### Context

Data center powered by non-renewable energy sources processes high volume of data and performs resource-intensive computations.

#### Trigger

System processes data and executes computations during normal operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- System minimizes carbon footprint by optimizing energy usage and resource allocation
- Energy consumption reduced by at least 20% compared to previous versions
- Optimization targets both computational efficiency and resource allocation strategies
