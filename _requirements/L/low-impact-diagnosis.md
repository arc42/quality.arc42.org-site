#### Context

Diagnostics subsystem must have minimal impact on system performance.

#### Trigger

Diagnostics subsystem is running during normal system operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Diagnostics subsystem has only minor impact on execution time of system functions and transactions
- Performance degradation due to diagnostics is measurable but minimal
- System functions execute with negligible overhead when diagnostics enabled
