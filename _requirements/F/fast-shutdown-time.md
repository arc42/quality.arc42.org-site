#### Background

Within a large corporation with many thousands of employees, the credentials (e.g. password, API-key) for the central employee database containing all personal information (e.g. salaries, health-issues etc) become compromised (e.g. stolen by a former employee or outside hacker).

#### 
#### Metric

To avoid a data breach this employee database shall be taken offline (aka _shutdown_) in less than 10 seconds from the moment the shutdown command was issued.
