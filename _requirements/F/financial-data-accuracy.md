#### Context/Background

A financial management system processes transaction data from multiple sources (payment gateways, banking APIs, accounting software) to generate quarterly financial reports for regulatory compliance and executive decision-making. Data quality issues in source systems have previously led to reporting errors that required manual correction and restatement of financial results.

#### Source

Financial transaction data is collected from various internal and external systems and must be validated before being used in regulatory reporting.

#### Metric/Acceptance Criteria

The financial data processing system must ensure:

* 99.99% accuracy of financial transaction data (maximum error rate of 1 in 10,000 transactions)
* 100% completeness of mandatory fields for all financial records
* Automated validation checks must flag at least 98% of data anomalies before data enters the reporting pipeline
* Data reconciliation between source systems and the central data warehouse must be performed hourly with a maximum discrepancy tolerance of 0.01%
* All data quality issues must be logged with severity levels and resolved within timeframes based on severity:
  * Critical: 1 hour
  * High: 4 hours
  * Medium: 24 hours
  * Low: 72 hours
