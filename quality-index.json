      "contentSummary": "Definition: >\"the state of being cheap enough for people to be able to buy.\" > >[Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/affordability) In the context of software system quality and software engineering, \"affordability\" generally refers to the cost-effectiveness of developing, deploying, maintaining, or acquiring a software system. When a software system is described as \"affordable,\" it means that its total cost — considering both initial costs and ongoing costs — provides good value for the capabilities and benefits it offers. Affordability in software engineering can encompass several aspects: * Development Costs: This includes the expenses associated with the design, development, testing, and deployment of the software. It factors in costs such as developer wages, software tools, infrastructure, training, and other related overheads. * Maintenance Costs: After the initial development, software systems need regular updates, patches, and potentially upgrades. Affordability considers how cost-effective it is to maintain and support the software throughout its lifecycle. * Licensing Costs: If the software uses third-party components or platforms, there may be licensing fees. Affordability takes into account the cumulative cost of these licenses. * Training Costs: An affordable software system should not require excessive training costs for users to become proficient. * Operational Costs: This covers costs related to running the software, including hosting, server maintenance, data storage, and more. * Scalability Costs: As the system grows or needs to support more users or data, there might be costs associated with scaling the system up. An affordable system should scale cost-effectively. (This explanation was created with help from ChatGPT v 4.0)",

      "contentSummary": "Code complexity refers to the level of intricacy, difficulty, or sophistication in a software program's source code. It is a measure of how challenging it is to understand, maintain, and modify the codebase. There are various metrics and methodologies used to assess code complexity, each aiming to provide insights into the code's quality and potential issues. Commonly used metrics to evaluate code complexity include: * Cyclomatic Complexity: It measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. Higher cyclomatic complexity indicates increased difficulty in understanding and maintaining the code. Tools like McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity can calculate this metric. * Halstead Complexity Measures: Developed by Maurice Halstead, these metrics are based on the number of operators, operands, and unique operators and operands in the code. They help in understanding the program's volume and difficulty. * Lines of Code (LOC): The number of lines in the source code. Though not a comprehensive measure of complexity, it can give some indication of a program's size and potential complexity. * Nesting Depth: It measures the depth of nested control structures within the code, which can impact code readability and maintainability. * Number of Dependencies: The number of external dependencies a module or class has. High dependency count can increase code complexity and make the codebase harder to manage. >A quantitative measure [whether there is not more than an adequate] number of linearly independent paths through a program’s source code. >It was developed by Thomas J. McCabe, Sr. in 1976. > >[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity) More precise: >The complexity measure approach we will take is to measure and control the number of paths through a program.

It involves designing and implementing software in a way that minimizes the amount of energy required to run the system, without compromising its functionality, performance, or user experience. >Energy efficiency has become a crucial consideration in modern software development due to the growing awareness of environmental sustainability and the increasing energy consumption of data centers and computing devices. As software systems have become more complex and resource-demanding, their energy consumption has also risen significantly. ### Aspects to consider for achieving energy efficiency There are several aspects to consider for achieving energy efficiency in software engineering: **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Choosing efficient algorithms and data structures can significantly impact the energy consumption of a system. Algorithms with lower computational complexity and optimized data structures can reduce processing time, resulting in energy savings. **Resource Management**: Properly managing system resources, such as CPU, memory, and network, can help reduce unnecessary energy usage. Implementing techniques like dynamic resource allocation, resource pooling, and power-saving modes can lead to more efficient resource utilization. **Minimized Redundancy**: Eliminating redundant computations and unnecessary operations in the code can reduce energy consumption. By streamlining the code and avoiding unnecessary processing, energy efficiency can be improved. **Performance Optimization**: Improving the overall performance of the system can lead to energy savings. Faster execution of tasks allows the system to enter power-saving states sooner, reducing the overall energy consumption. **Power Management**: Incorporating power management features into software, such as sleep mode, hibernation, and intelligent power management, can help reduce energy usage during idle periods. **Green Computing**:...",

Independence is important because it makes implementation more accessible and faster. The independent modules are easier to maintain, test, and reduce error propagation and can be reused in other programs as well. Thus, functional independence is a good design feature which ensures software quality. > > [javatpoint.com](https://www.javatpoint.com/software-engineering-software-design-principles) [Martin-2018, p. 148](/references/#martin-clean-architecture) states within the frame of software architecture to have independence the > software architecture must support > > - The use cases and operations of the system. > - The maintenance of the system > - The development of the system > - The deployment of the system #### Use Cases > Use cases are a very natural way to divide the system.

This is accomplished by properly partitioning the system into well-isolated, independently developable components. > [Martin-2018, p. 150](/references/#martin-clean-architecture) #### Independent Deployment > The decoupling of the use cases and layers also affords a high degree of flexibility in deployment.

In terms of _organizational coupling_ (i.e. microservices or self-contained-systems) this argument was replaced by potentially faster [time-to-marked](/qualities/time-to-market) or [speed-to-market](/_qualities/speed-to-market). * redundant data was considered harmful due to higher storage costs.

An SCS can fulfill its primary use cases on its own, without having to rely on other systems being available. > - Each SCS is owned by one team. This does not necessarily mean that only one team can change the code, but the owning team has the final say on what goes into the code base, for example by merging pull-requests. > - Communication with other SCSs or 3rd party systems is asynchronous wherever possible. Specifically, other SCSs or external systems should not be accessed synchronously within the SCS's own request/response cycle. This decouples the systems, reduces the effects of failure, and thus supports autonomy. The goal is decoupling concerning time: An SCS should work even if other SCSs are temporarily offline. This can be achieved even if the communication on the technical level is synchronous, e.g. by replicating data or buffering requests. > - An SCS can have an optional service API. Because the SCS has its own web UI, it can interact with the user — without going through a UI service. However, an API for mobile clients or for other SCSs might still be useful. > - Each SCS must include data and logic. To really implement any meaningful features both are needed. An SCS should implement features by itself and must therefore include both. > - An SCS should make its features usable to end-users via its own UI.

Time to market\" in software engineering refers to the duration it takes to develop, test, and release a software product or feature from its initial conception. It measures how quickly a software project can go from ideation to being available for users. A small or low time-to-market allows organizations to respond rapidly to market demands, gain a competitive edge, and deliver value to customers sooner.",
