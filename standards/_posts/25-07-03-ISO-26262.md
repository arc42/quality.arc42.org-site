## ISO 26262 is an international standard titled:

"Road vehicles — Functional safety"

It is an international standard for functional safety of electrical and/or electronic systems in production automobiles.

## Quality Attributes Required or Emphasized

The standard is centered around functional safety, aiming to mitigate risks associated with system malfunctions.

| Attribute | Relevance in ISO 26262 |
|:--- |:--- |
| **[Safety](qualities/safety)** | The core focus. The standard defines a safety lifecycle and Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs) to classify risk. |
| **[Reliability](qualities/reliability)** | Crucial for safety. It requires systematic analysis of failure modes, rates, and effects (e.g., FMEA). |
| **[Fault Tolerance](qualities/fault-tolerance)** | Addressed through requirements for hardware and software architectural design, including redundancy and diagnostic capabilities. |
| **[Testability](qualities/testability)** | Mandates comprehensive verification and validation activities throughout the development process. |
| **[Traceability](qualities/traceability)** | Required to ensure a clear link between requirements, design, implementation, and tests for safety-critical functions. |

**Note:** ISO 26262 is a comprehensive standard that applies to the entire lifecycle of safety-related automotive systems.
