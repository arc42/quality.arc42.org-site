>Bias mitigation refers to the systematic identification and reduction of unfair prejudice in algorithmic systems, particularly those using artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
>It involves techniques and practices designed to prevent, detect, and address algorithmic biases that could lead to discriminatory outcomes against individuals or groups based on protected characteristics.

## Key Aspects of Bias Mitigation

Bias mitigation encompasses several important dimensions:

1. **Pre-processing techniques**: Methods applied to training data before model development to reduce inherent biases
2. **In-processing techniques**: Modifications to learning algorithms during model training to ensure fairness
3. **Post-processing techniques**: Adjustments to model outputs after training to correct for biased predictions
4. **Continuous monitoring**: Ongoing evaluation of deployed systems to detect emergent biases
5. **Diverse representation**: Ensuring diversity in data collection, algorithm design teams, and testing populations

## Relationship to Other Qualities

Bias mitigation is closely connected to several other system qualities:

- It is essential for **fairness** as it directly addresses discriminatory outcomes
- It supports **transparency** by making algorithmic decision-making more understandable
- It enhances **reliability** by ensuring consistent performance across different user groups
- It contributes to **safety** by preventing harmful impacts on vulnerable populations
- It improves **accountability** by establishing responsibility for algorithmic outcomes
