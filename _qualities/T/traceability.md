> **Traceability** is the ability to recover all of the artifacts that led to an element having a problem.
> That includes all the code and dependencies that are included in that element.
> It also includes the test cases that were run on that element and the tools that were used to produce the element.
> Errors in tools used in the deployment pipeline can cause problems in production.

> - the identification and documentation of derivation paths (upward) and allocation or flowdown paths (downward) of work products in the work product hierarchy;
> - the degree to which each element in a software development product establishes its reason for existing; and
> - discernible association among two or more logical entities, such as requirements, system elements, verifications, or tasks.
