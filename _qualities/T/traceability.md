>**Traceability** is the ability to recover all of the artifacts that led to an element having a problem. 
>That includes all the code and dependencies that are included in that element. 
>It also includes the test cases that were run on that element and the tools that were used to produce the element. 
>Errors in tools used in the deployment pipeline can cause problems in production.

>* the degree to which a relationship can be established between two or more products of the development process, especially products having a predecessor-successor or primary-subordinate relationship to one another; 
>* the identification and documentation of derivation paths (upward) and allocation or flowdown paths (downward) of work products in the work product hierarchy;
>* the degree to which each element in a software development product establishes its reason for existing; and 
>* discernible association among two or more logical entities, such as requirements, system elements, verifications, or tasks.
