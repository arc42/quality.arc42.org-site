Timeliness (also known as currentness) is a critical data quality dimension that measures whether data reflects the current state of the real-world entities it represents and is available at the right time for its intended use.

**Key aspects:**

- **Temporal accuracy**: Data values reflect the current state, not outdated information
- **Update frequency**: Data is refreshed at appropriate intervals
- **Availability timing**: Data is accessible when users need it for decisions
- **Age of data**: Time elapsed since data was last updated or validated

**Examples:**

- **Financial trading**: Stock prices must be real-time or near-real-time
- **Healthcare**: Patient vital signs and medication records must be current
- **Inventory management**: Stock levels must reflect actual warehouse quantities
- **Weather forecasting**: Meteorological data must be recent for accurate predictions
- **Regulatory reporting**: Compliance data must be current to meet filing deadlines

Timeliness directly impacts decision quality—outdated data leads to poor decisions, while timely data enables effective action.
