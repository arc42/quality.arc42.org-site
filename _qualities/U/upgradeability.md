Upgradeability refers to the ability of a software system or product to be easily and efficiently upgraded or updated to newer versions, typically without causing disruptions to existing functionality or requiring significant reconfiguration. 

An upgradeable system allows for the seamless installation of patches, enhancements, or major version changes while maintaining its reliability, compatibility, and performance.
