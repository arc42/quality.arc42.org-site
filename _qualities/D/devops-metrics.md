[Four key devops metrics](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/frameworks/devops-metrics):


>1. **Lead time for changes**: the length of time between when a code change is committed to the trunk branch and when it is in a deployable state. 
>1. **Change failure rate**: the percentage of code changes that require hot fixes or other remediation after production. 
>1. **Deployment frequency**: how often new code is deployed into production  
>1. **Mean time to recovery**: how long it takes to recover from a partial service interruption or total failure.
