>**Deployment frequency**: how often new code is deployed into production.

>Many practitioners use the term “delivery” to mean code changes that are released into a pre-production staging environment, and reserve “deployment” to refer to code changes that are released into production.

>High-performing teams can deploy changes on demand, and often do so many times a day. 
>Lower-performing teams are often limited to deploying weekly or monthly.  
>
>The ability to deploy on demand requires an automated deployment pipeline that incorporates automated testing and feedback mechanisms, and minimizes the need for human intervention.
