Data Integrity is the assurance that data is and remains accurate, consistent, and complete over its entire lifecycle. It is a fundamental component of information security and data management.

## Rationale

Without data integrity, data may become corrupted, inaccurate, or unusable. This can lead to flawed decision-making, operational errors, and a loss of trust in the system.

Data integrity is typically enforced through a variety of mechanisms, including:

*   **Entity Integrity:** Ensuring that each entity or record is uniquely identifiable (e.g., through primary keys).
*   **Referential Integrity:** Ensuring that relationships between data entities remain valid (e.g., using foreign keys).
*   **Domain Integrity:** Ensuring that data values conform to a specified range or format.
*   **Transactional Integrity:** Ensuring that data transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID properties).
