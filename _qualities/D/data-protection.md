### Overview

Data protection covers both the **operational backup** of data and **data security/privacy**. It ensures that data is not only safe from hackers and unauthorized access but also available for use when needed (e.g., after a system failure).

In many jurisdictions, "Data Protection" specifically refers to the legal framework for protecting personal data, such as the **GDPR** in the European Union.

### Core Principles (e.g. from GDPR)

*   **Lawfulness, fairness and transparency**
*   **Purpose limitation**
*   **Data minimization**
*   **Accuracy**
*   **Storage limitation**
*   **Integrity and confidentiality (security)**
*   **Accountability**
