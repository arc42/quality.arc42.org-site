## Definitions

>Data quality refers to the state of qualitative or quantitative pieces of information. 
>Data is generally considered high quality if it is "fit for [its] intended uses in operations, decision making and planning". 
>Data is deemed of high quality if it correctly represents the real-world construct to which it refers.

>The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of data fulfills requirements. 
>Data quality characteristics will be of varying importance and priority to different stakeholders.

## Common Dimensions of Data Quality

Data quality is typically characterized by multiple dimensions:

1. **Accuracy**: The degree to which data correctly reflects the real-world entity or event it represents
2. **Completeness**: The degree to which all required data is present
3. **Consistency**: The degree to which data is free from contradictions and coherent with other data
4. **Timeliness**: The degree to which data is up-to-date and available when required
5. **Validity**: The degree to which data conforms to defined business rules or constraints
6. **Uniqueness**: The degree to which data is free from redundancy at all required levels
7. **Integrity**: The degree to which data maintains referential integrity and relationships

## Relationship to Other Qualities

Data quality is foundational to many other system qualities:

- It directly impacts **reliability** as systems cannot function correctly with poor quality data
- It is essential for **usability** as users need trustworthy data to make decisions
- It affects **security** as data integrity is a key security concern
- It influences **maintainability** as poor data quality increases maintenance costs
- It is critical for **functional suitability** as functions depend on correct data
