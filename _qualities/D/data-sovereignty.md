### Key Aspects

*   **Data Residency**: The physical or geographic location of where an organization's data or information is stored.
*   **Data Localization**: The requirement that data about a nation's citizens or residents be collected, processed, and/or stored inside the country.
*   **Jurisdiction**: The legal authority under which data is governed, often determined by the physical location of the data or the location of the data controller.

### Why it matters

Data sovereignty is crucial for:
*   **Compliance** with regional regulations like GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), or LGPD (Brazil).
*   **Security** against unauthorized access by foreign governments or entities.
*   **Trust** between service providers and their customers regarding the handling of sensitive information.
*   **Digital Sovereignty**: The broader concept of a state's ability to act independently in the digital world.
