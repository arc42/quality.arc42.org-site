<hr>

Data sovereignty (DS) is a key concern in modern distributed systems, especially when processing personal or sensitive information across international borders. It ensures that the data controller maintains self-determination over the data and adheres to the legal requirements of the relevant jurisdictions.

### Key Aspects

*   **Legal Jurisdiction**: Data is subject to the legal protections (and requirements) of the country where it is stored or processed.
*   **Self-Determination**: The ability of an entity to maintain control over its own data.
*   **Compliance**: Meeting requirements of regulations like GDPR, CCPA, or regional data laws.

### Related Concepts

*   **[Data Residency](/qualities/data-residency)**: The physical location of the data.
*   **[Data Localization](/qualities/data-localization)**: The legal requirement to keep data within a specific country.
