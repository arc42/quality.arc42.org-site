### Definitions

> In machine learning, fairness refers to the absence of any prejudice or favoritism toward an individual or group based on their inherent or acquired characteristics; many formal criteria (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds, equal opportunity) are used to assess it.

### Scope and Intent
- Aim: ensure outcomes and error rates are not unjustifiably different across protected groups.
- Typical metrics: disparate impact (80% rule), demographic parity difference, equal opportunity (TPR parity), equalized odds (TPR/FPR parity), calibration within groups.
- Lifecycle: apply mitigation pre-/in-/postâ€‘processing and monitor drift and disparities in production.
