Please note: Max Kanat-Alexander was the person responsible at Google for code health.

He has authored a (imho very fine!) book on "Code Simplicity", which he made [available for-free](https://www.codesimplicity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CodeSimplicity.pdf).

I quote from this book again:


>#### Why Simplicity?
>If any appliance in my house malfunctioned as often as my computer does, I would
return it. 
>Users (and sometimes even programmers) have become used the idea that “software just has bugs.” 
>People seem to just accept that systems will bloat over time, becoming unmaintainable and unstable monstrosities that eventually have to be
thrown away and re-written.
>But none of this is inevitable. 
>Instability, bloat, and various other code problems don’t arise out of some natural law of the universe that requires all software to suck.
>Instead, they arise almost entirely out of complexity
>
>Max Kanat-Alexander, again...
