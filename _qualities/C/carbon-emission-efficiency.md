>* carbon dioxide (CO2), 
>* methane (CH4), 
>* nitrous oxide (N2O), 
>* hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 
>* perfluorocarbons (PFCs), 
>* sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and 
>* nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).

>It is common practice to express GHGs as a single unit, CO2-equivalents (CO2e), signifying the amount of CO2 that would have the equivalent impact on global warming.
