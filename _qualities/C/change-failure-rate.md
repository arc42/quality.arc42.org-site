>**Change failure rate**: the percentage of code changes that require hot fixes or other remediation after production. 
>This does not measure failures caught by testing and fixed before code is deployed.

>High-performing teams have change failure rates in the 0-15 percent range. 
>
>The same practices that enable shorter lead times — test automation, trunk-based development, and working in small batches — correlate with a reduction in change failure rates. 
>All these practices make defects much easier to identify and remediate.
