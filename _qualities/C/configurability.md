# configurable, Configurability

Configurability refers to the ability of a system, software application, or hardware device to be easily customized and adapted to suit various requirements, preferences, and environments. 
A configurable system allows users or administrators to modify its settings, features, or behavior without the need for extensive code changes or hardware modifications. 
Configurability empowers users to tailor the system to their specific needs, making it more versatile and adaptable.
