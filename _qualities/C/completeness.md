>Completeness can be measured at different levels:
>- **Schema completeness**: All required tables and columns exist
>- **Column completeness**: Percentage of non-null values in required fields
>- **Population completeness**: All expected entities are represented in the dataset

Completeness is particularly critical in:
- Healthcare systems (complete patient records)
- Financial reporting (all transactions recorded)
- Regulatory compliance (all required data elements present)
- Master data management (complete entity profiles)
