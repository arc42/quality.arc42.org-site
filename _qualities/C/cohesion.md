>In computer programming, cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.
>
>Cohesion is an ordinal type of measurement and is usually described as “high cohesion” or “low cohesion”. 
>Modules with high cohesion tend to be preferable, because high cohesion is associated with several desirable traits of software including robustness, reliability, reusability, and understandability.

And, from a gem of software engineering literature ("Structured Design" by Ed Yourdon and Larry Constantine) from 1978:

>How tightly bound or related its internal elements are to one another.
