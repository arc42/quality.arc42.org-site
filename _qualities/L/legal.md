>As the world becomes more dependent on digital products and services, data privacy has increasingly become a top priority for many countries and regions. As a result, many regions have put in place robust and enforceable data regulations by which businesses are expected to comply.

> In most cases, non-compliance with these regulations can not only lead to major financial consequences, but it can also lead to significant and lasting damage to public trust and the reputation of your organization. It is, therefore, important to ensure that your business meets its legal obligations.
