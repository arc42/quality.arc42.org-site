Portability can be related to source code, configurations and **data**.
For example, data might be encoded in [EBCDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC) on a mainframe computer, and not readable by modern machines.

> Effort required to transfer a program from one hardware configuration and/or software system environment to another.
