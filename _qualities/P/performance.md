Performance relative to the amount of resources used under stated conditions. 
Composed of the following sub-characteristics:

* Time behaviour - Degree to which the response and processing times and throughput rates of a product or system, when performing its functions, meet requirements.
* Resource utilization - Degree to which the amounts and types of resources used by a product or system, when performing its functions, meet requirements.
* Capacity - Degree to which the maximum limits of a product or system parameter meet requirements.
