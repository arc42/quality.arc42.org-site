In the context of software system quality and software engineering, affordability refers to the cost-effectiveness of developing, deploying, maintaining, or acquiring a software system. When a software system is described as "affordable," it means that its total cost — considering both initial costs and ongoing costs — provides good value for the capabilities and benefits it offers.

Affordability in software engineering can encompass several aspects:
* **Development Costs**: Expenses for design, development, testing, and deployment — including developer wages, software tools, infrastructure, and training.
* **Maintenance Costs**: Regular updates, patches, and upgrades over the system's lifecycle.
* **Licensing Costs**: Cumulative cost of third-party components, platforms, or services.
* **Training Costs**: Effort and expense required for users to become proficient.
* **Operational Costs**: Running costs including hosting, server maintenance, and data storage.
* **Scalability Costs**: Expenses associated with growing the system to support more users or data.

### Budget Constraints

A budget constraint is a specific expression of affordability: the upper limit on what an organization is willing or able to spend. While affordability is the quality attribute (does the system provide good value for its cost?), a budget constraint is the project-level boundary that operationalizes it.
