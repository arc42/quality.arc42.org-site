Observability in the context of software engineering refers to the ability to understand and analyze the internal state and behavior of a software system based on the data it generates. 

Observability encompasses three main pillars: logs, metrics, and traces. 


Observability allows software engineers to gain a holistic understanding of their systems, enabling them to detect and diagnose issues more effectively. 

It helps in troubleshooting, performance optimization, capacity planning, and overall system reliability.
