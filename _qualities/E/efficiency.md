<hr>

Sometimes _efficiency_ is misunderstood for _effectiveness_:
Therefore, please remember:


Efficiency is doing things right, while effectiveness is doing the right things.

<hr>

>The words effective and efficient both mean "capable of producing a result," but there is an important difference. Effective means "producing a result that is wanted". Efficient means "capable of producing desired results without wasting materials, time, or energy".
> 
>The difference is that when something is effective it produces a result even if it takes some unnecessary resources to do so. When something is efficient, not only does it produce a result, but it does so in a quick or simple way using as little material, time, effort, or energy as possible. The following example sentences show how the two words are used.
