### Definitions

> Interchangeability is the ability to substitute one component, part, or element with another of the same type without requiring modifications to the system or loss of functionality.

<hr class="with-no-margin"/>

> The capacity of a product or system to allow replacement of components, modules, or interfaces with functionally equivalent alternatives without impacting overall system behavior.
>
> Related to ISO/IEC 25010 concepts of [Replaceability](/qualities/replaceability), [Modularity](/qualities/modularity), and [Compatibility](/qualities/compatibility)

### Scope and Intent

- **Aim**: Enable seamless substitution of components, modules, services, or interfaces with functionally equivalent alternatives
- **Techniques**: Standardized interfaces, well-defined contracts, loose coupling, abstraction layers, dependency injection, plug-in architectures
- **Evidence**: Time to swap components (e.g., ≤ 1 hour), success rate of component substitution (≥ 95%), number of systems requiring custom adapters kept minimal

### Key Aspects

**Component Level**: Individual software modules, libraries, or services can be replaced without affecting dependent components

**Interface Level**: APIs, protocols, and data formats follow standards that allow different implementations to be substituted

**Configuration Level**: System behavior can be altered through configuration rather than code changes

**Deployment Level**: Different versions or implementations can be deployed interchangeably in various environments

### Notes

- **[Replaceability](/qualities/replaceability)**: ISO/IEC 25010 characteristic focusing on replacing entire products in the same environment
- **Interchangeability**: Focuses on internal component substitution within a system or product family
- **[Modularity](/qualities/modularity)**: Supports interchangeability by ensuring components have clear boundaries and minimal coupling
- **[Compatibility](/qualities/compatibility)**: Ensures interchangeable components can coexist and communicate effectively
