### Definitions

> Integrability is the ease with which a software component or system can be integrated with other components or systems.

<hr class="with-no-margin"/>

> The degree to which a system or component can be incorporated into other systems with minimal effort and without requiring significant modifications to either system.
>
>Based on software engineering principles (IEEE 1061-1998)

### Scope and Intent
- Aim: enable seamless combination of software components and systems with minimal integration effort.
- Techniques: standardized interfaces, well-defined APIs, loose coupling, configuration management, comprehensive documentation, automated deployment.
- Evidence: integration time metrics, interface compatibility tests, successful third-party integrations, minimal custom adapter code required.
