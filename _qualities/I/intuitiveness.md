## Definitions

>The degree to which a system's interface, behavior, and information organization align with users' existing mental models and expectations, enabling immediate understanding and effective use without prior learning or training.

<hr class="with-no-margin"/>

>Intuitiveness refers to the immediate understandability of a user interface. An intuitive interface allows users to accomplish their goals without having to think about how to use the interface.

>An intuitive user interface is one that works the way users expect it to work. It behaves consistently, both internally and with regard to other applications the user may know.

>Intuitive design is about creating interfaces that work the way users expect them to work. When users can predict what will happen next, they feel more confident and in control.

## Key Characteristics

- **Immediate recognition** rather than recall
- **Familiar patterns and metaphors** that match user expectations
- **Predictable behavior** across similar functions
- **Natural information architecture** following mental models
- **Consistency** with established interface conventions
- **Minimal cognitive load** for first-time users

## Relationship to Other Qualities

**Intuitiveness complements but differs from:**

- **[Usability](/qualities/usability)**: Focuses on task effectiveness vs. immediate understanding
- **[Learnability](/qualities/learnability)**: Concerns acquisition time vs. no learning required
- **[Ease of Use](/qualities/ease-of-use)**: Addresses operational simplicity vs. cognitive alignment
- **[Clarity](/qualities/clarity)**: Ensures clear communication vs. natural comprehension
- **[User Experience](/qualities/user-experience)**: Encompasses broader interaction vs. initial understanding

## Measurement Approaches

- **Time to first successful action** without training
- **Error rate on initial use** before learning occurs
- **User confidence scores** during first interaction
- **Task completion rate** on first attempt
- **Subjective "naturalness" ratings** from users
