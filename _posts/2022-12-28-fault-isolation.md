>Fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) is a subfield of control engineering which concerns itself with monitoring a system, identifying when a fault has occurred, and pinpointing the type of fault and its location. 
>Two approaches can be distinguished: 
>A direct pattern recognition of sensor readings that indicate a fault and an analysis of the discrepancy between the sensor readings and expected values, derived from some model. 
>In the latter case, it is typical that a fault is said to be detected if the discrepancy or residual goes above a certain threshold. 
>It is then the task of fault isolation to categorize the type of fault and its location in the machinery.
