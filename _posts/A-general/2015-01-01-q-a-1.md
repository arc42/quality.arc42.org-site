"**42**" is a quotation from the science-fiction novel
[_Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) by the famous [Douglas Adams](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/03/douglas-adams-42-hitchhiker).

In his book the number _**42**_ is the "answer to the meaning of life, the universe, and everything" - calculated by a _very_ big computer over a _very very_ long time:


>"All right," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the Great Question..."
>
>"Yes..!"
>
>"Of Life, the Universe and Everything..." said Deep Thought.
>
>"Yes...!"
>
>"Is..." said Deep Thought, and paused.
>
>"Yes...!"
>
>"Is..."
>
>"Yes...!!!...?"
>
>"Forty-two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.”

Software developers like to use 42 as _magic_ number, that's a number without any real significance, which you could replace by any other number. Of course the name _arc42_ wouldn't sound half as cool if we had choosen another number...
