Applies to several _stages_ in the life of a system or product, for example:

* at development or compile time, 
* installation or deployment time,
* during testing
* at runtime

>Flexibility to context of use should consider two distinguished aspects, i.e., technical and non-technical. Technical aspect is related with execution environment of products, such as software, hardware and communication facility, and non-technical aspect is related with social environment ,such as user and task, and physical environment, such as climate and nature.

The ease with which the product can be: 
* adapted to changes in its requirements, or infrastructure
* modified without introducing defects,
* transferred to different hardware, software or other operational or usage environments

<hr class="with-no-margin"/>

A system can **easily** be changed (as opposed to agility, which means that system can _rapidly_ be changed.)
