### Definitions

> A system S is explainable with respect to an aspect X of S relative to an adressee A in context C if and only if there is an entity E (the explainer) who, by giving a corpus of infomration I (the explanation of X), enables A to understand X of S in C.

> Explainable AI (XAI) [..] either refers to an AI system over which it is possible for humans to retain intellectual oversight, or to the methods to achieve this.

> [..] local explainability helps answer the question, “for this particular example, why did the model make this particular decision?”
> 
>Cohort explainability is the process of understanding to what degree your model’s features contribute to its predictions over a subset of your data.
> 
> We consider an ML engineer to have access to global model explainability if across all predictions they are able to attribute which features contributed the most to the model’s decisions.
