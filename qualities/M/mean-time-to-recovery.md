>**Mean time to recovery (MTTR)** measures how long it takes to recover from a partial service interruption or total failure.

>High-performing teams recover from system failures quickly — usually in less than an hour — whereas lower-performing teams may take up to a week to recover from a failure. 
>
>The ability to recover quickly from a failure depends on the ability to quickly identify when a failure occurs, and deploy a fix or roll-back any changes that led to the failure. 
>This is usually done by continuously monitoring system health and alerting operations staff in the event of a failure.

>The focus on MTTR is a shift away from the historical practice of focusing on mean time between failures (MTBF). 
>It reflects the increased complexity of modern applications and thus, an increased expectancy of failure.
