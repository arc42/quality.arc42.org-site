>Information security is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. 
>It is part of information risk management. 
>It typically involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized or inappropriate access to data or the unlawful use, >disclosure, disruption, deletion, corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or devaluation of information. 
>It also involves actions intended to reduce the adverse impacts of such incidents. 
>Protected information may take any form, e.g., electronic or physical, tangible (e.g., paperwork), or intangible (e.g., knowledge). >Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability (also known as the 'CIA' triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity. 
>This is largely achieved through a structured risk management process. (Wikipedia)
