Stability has two different meanings:

1. Stability at **runtime**: free from severe errors that cause interruption of system function.
2. Stability in **development**: When adding new features, existing parts can remain largely unchanged.

For the second part, consider this quote:

>Software stability means the resistance to the amplification of changes in software.
