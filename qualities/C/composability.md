>Composability is a system design principle that deals with the inter-relationships of components. A highly composable system provides components that can be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements.

Composability refers to the design principle of creating modular, reusable software components that can be combined and recombined to build new applications and systems. The key aspects of composability include:

* **Modularity**: Components are designed to do one thing well, are self-contained, and can be deployed independently.
* **Autonomy**: Components don't depend on other components and can be updated independently without affecting the rest of the system. 
* **Discoverability**: Components and their capabilities are easy to find and integrate into new systems.
* **Reusability**: Components can be reused across multiple projects and systems without needing significant modifications.
* **Interoperability**: Components can communicate and exchange data with each other through well-defined interfaces.
