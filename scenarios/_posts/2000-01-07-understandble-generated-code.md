**Stimulus**: A developer has created a new test case in xml.

**Reaction**: The code generator creates a source code file.

**Metric**: A human tester can understand the generated test and enhance it with additional tests or test-data within max 30 minutes. 

**Background**: Test cases for a system are described in a (semi-)formal xml-based language and automatically converted into Java, Kotlin or Groovy source code. This code is later adjusted or enhanced by developers or testers.
