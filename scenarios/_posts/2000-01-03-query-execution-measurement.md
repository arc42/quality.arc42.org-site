<div class="arc42-help" markdown="1">
**Background**: We execute a large number of cpu- and memory-intensive database queries within our system. 
A dignostic component can measure the execution time of these queries, if `query-diagnosis` configuration is turned on.

* Query diagnosis must not add more than 1% or 2msec runtime overhead to the queries, whichever is larger. For example:  
   * a query which takes 200msec to complete must not take more than 202msec with diagnosis, 
   * a 100msec query not more than 102msec.

* Query diagnosis must not add more than 1MB memory footprint to system execution.
