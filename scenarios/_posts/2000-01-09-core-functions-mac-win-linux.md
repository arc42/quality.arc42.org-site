<div class="arc42-help" markdown="1">

**Background**: The system offers a few complex core business functions.

* These core functions can be re-used on Mac-OS, Windows and Linux applications without changes to their source.
* Future releases or distributions of these operating systems shall not affect their ability to work on these platforms, at least in comparable execution environments (concerning cpu and memory capacity).
