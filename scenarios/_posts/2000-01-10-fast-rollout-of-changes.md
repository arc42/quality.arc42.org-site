**Background**: More than 1000 devices running our system are distributed _in the field_ in customer sites on various locations.

**Stimulus**: The operating system we use gets a security update which needs to be rolled out to every one of these devices 

**Reaction**: An OS update or patch is created.

**Metric**: It takes less than 4 weeks to distribute and install this update or patch on all of these devices.
