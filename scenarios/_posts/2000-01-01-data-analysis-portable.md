<div class="arc42-help" markdown="1">
**Background**: Business data in stored in different databases (MySql, PostgreSQL, Oracle, DB2).
Integrity and consistency of certain data types need to be checked across these databases.
A checking tool (BuDIC) has been developed, that is able to access several datasources at once.

* The BuDIC tool needs to be compatible with the latest versions of MySql, PostgreSQL, Oracle and DB2.
* If an update or new version of one of these databases is released by the respective vendor, BuDIC can be updated to be compliant with the new version within 2 person-days of development and test effort.
