## ISO/IEC 25022: Systems and software engineering â€” Measurement of quality in use

This standard is part of the ISO/IEC 25000 (SQuaRE) series. It defines measures for the characteristics of the "quality in use" model defined in ISO/IEC 25010.

### Key ideas

-   **Focus on "Quality in Use":** The standard provides a framework for measuring the quality of a system from the user's perspective.
-   **Metrics for Quality Characteristics:** It defines a set of measures for the five characteristics of quality in use: effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, freedom from risk, and context coverage.
-   **Context is Key:** The standard emphasizes that the measurement of quality in use must be done in a specific context of use.
-   **Guidance for Measurement:** It provides guidance on how to apply the measures and how to interpret the results.

### Quality Attributes (Quality in Use Characteristics)

The standard defines measures for the following quality in use characteristics:

| Attribute | Relevance in ISO/IEC 25022 |
|:--- |:--- |
| **[Effectiveness](/qualities/effectiveness)** | The accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals. |
| **[Efficiency](/qualities/efficiency)** | The resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals. |
| **[Satisfaction](/qualities/satisfaction)** | The degree to which user needs are satisfied when a product or system is used in a specified context of use. |
| **[Freedom from risk](/qualities/freedom-from-risk)** | The degree to which a product or system mitigates the potential for economic risk, health and safety risk, and environmental risk. |
| **[Context Coverage](/qualities/context-coverage)** | The degree to which a product or system can be used with effectiveness, efficiency, freedom from risk and satisfaction in all the specified contexts of use. |
