## ISO/IEC 14756: Measurement and rating of performance of computer-based software systems

This standard specifies the user-oriented performance of computer-based software systems (CBSS) and provides a method for measuring and rating these values. It focuses on execution speed, described by three main factors: execution time, throughput, and timeliness.

## Performance-related Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| **[Performance Efficiency](/qualities/performance-efficiency)** | The performance relative to the amount of resources used under stated conditions. |
| **[Time Behaviour](/qualities/time-behaviour)** | The degree to which the response and processing times and throughput rates of a product or system, when performing its functions, meet requirements. |
| Execution Time | The time taken to execute a task. |
| Throughput | The amount of work performed in a given time. |
| Timeliness | The degree to which a product or system provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions. |
