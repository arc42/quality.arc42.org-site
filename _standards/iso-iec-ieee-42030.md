## ISO/IEC/IEEE 42030:2019 - Software, Systems and Enterprise Architecture Evaluation Framework

This international standard provides a systematic framework for evaluating architectures of systems, software, and enterprises. It establishes a structured approach to architecture evaluation that supports informed decision-making about architecture quality, fitness for purpose, and compliance with stakeholder needs.

ISO/IEC/IEEE 42030 extends and complements ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 by focusing on the evaluation aspects of architecture work. While 42010 addresses how to describe architectures, 42030 addresses how to systematically evaluate their quality and effectiveness.

## Architecture Evaluation Framework

The standard defines a comprehensive evaluation framework consisting of several key components:

| Component | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| **Architecture Evaluation Process** | Systematic methodology for conducting architecture evaluations with defined phases, activities, and deliverables. |
| **Evaluation Objectives** | Clear specification of what the evaluation aims to achieve, including quality attributes, architectural decisions, and stakeholder concerns. |
| **Evaluation Methods** | Systematic approaches for conducting evaluations, including scenario-based methods, metrics-based analysis, and stakeholder reviews. |
| **Architecture Quality Models** | Frameworks for assessing architecture quality attributes such as performance, security, maintainability, and reliability. |
| **Evaluation Criteria** | Explicit criteria for judging architecture quality, including thresholds, targets, and acceptance criteria. |
| **Stakeholder Involvement** | Systematic engagement of stakeholders throughout the evaluation process to ensure relevance and buy-in. |

## Quality Attributes Emphasized by the Standard

The standard directly addresses architecture evaluation across multiple quality dimensions:

| Quality Attribute | Relevance in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42030 |
|:--- |:--- |
| Evaluability | Core focus on making architectures systematically assessable through defined evaluation processes and criteria. This quality overlaps with [Testability](/qualities/testability), [Observability](/qualities/observability) and [Analysability](/qualities/analysability) |
| **[Traceability](/qualities/traceability)** | Ensuring clear links between architectural decisions, quality requirements, and evaluation results. |
| **[Transparency](/qualities/transparency)** | Making evaluation processes, criteria, and results visible and understandable to stakeholders. |
| **[Accountability](/qualities/accountability)** | Providing systematic evidence and rationale for architecture quality assessments and decisions. |
| **[Maintainability](/qualities/maintainability)** | Evaluating how well the architecture supports ongoing modification and evolution. |
| **[Performance](/qualities/performance)** | Systematic assessment of architecture's ability to meet performance requirements and constraints. |
| **[Security](/qualities/security)** | Evaluation of architecture's security properties, vulnerabilities, and risk mitigation approaches. |
| **[Reliability](/qualities/reliability)** | Assessment of architecture's dependability, fault tolerance, and failure recovery capabilities. |
| **[Scalability](/qualities/scalability)** | Evaluation of architecture's ability to handle growth in load, data, or functional requirements. |
| **[Interoperability](/qualities/interoperability)** | Assessment of architecture's integration capabilities and compliance with interface standards. |

## Key Evaluation Methods and Techniques

### **Scenario-Based Evaluation**
- Use cases and quality attribute scenarios for systematic assessment
- Stakeholder-driven scenario development and prioritization
- Architecture walkthrough against representative scenarios

### **Metrics-Based Analysis**
- Quantitative measurement of architecture properties
- Structural complexity metrics and quality indicators  
- Performance modeling and capacity analysis

### **Stakeholder Review Methods**
- Architecture review boards and evaluation committees
- Systematic stakeholder feedback collection and analysis
- Trade-off identification and decision support

### **Risk-Based Assessment**
- Architecture risk identification and impact analysis
- Technical debt assessment and management strategies
- Evolution roadmap evaluation and planning

## Evaluation Process Phases

### **Planning Phase**
- Define evaluation objectives, scope, and success criteria
- Identify stakeholders and their concerns
- Select appropriate evaluation methods and techniques

### **Execution Phase**
- Conduct systematic architecture evaluation activities
- Collect and analyze evidence against evaluation criteria
- Document findings, issues, and recommendations

### **Reporting Phase**
- Communicate evaluation results to stakeholders
- Provide actionable recommendations and improvement strategies
- Support architecture decision-making and governance

## Benefits for Architecture Quality

- **Systematic Quality Assessment**: Structured approach to evaluating architecture fitness for purpose
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early identification of architecture issues and quality risks
- **Decision Support**: Evidence-based input for architecture and design decisions
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Shared understanding of architecture quality and trade-offs
- **Continuous Improvement**: Foundation for iterative architecture refinement and evolution
