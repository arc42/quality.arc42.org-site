## ISO/IEC 25019: Systems and software engineering — Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) — Quality-in-use model

This standard, published in November 2023, defines a quality-in-use model. It is part of the SQuaRE (Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation) series of standards. 

Quality-in-use is the effect of a system's usage, the outcome of the interaction with a system. It reflects the view of stakeholders influenced by the system in a specified context of use.

ISO/IEC 25019:2023 replaces the quality-in-use model that was previously part of ISO/IEC 25010:2011, together with ISO/IEC 25002 and ISO/IEC 25010:2023.

## Quality-in-use Model Characteristics

The quality-in-use model is composed of three main characteristics:

| Characteristic | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| **Beneficialness** | extent of benefit resulting from the use of a product, system or service |
| **Freedom from Risk** | extent to which a product or system mitigates the potential risk to economic status, human life, health, society, financial values, enterprise activities, or the environment |
| **Acceptability** | extent to which a human response is favourable when accepting or installing a product, system or service software tool designed to perform some frequently used function |

### 3.2.1 Beneficialness

*   **3.2.1.1 Usability**: extent to which a system, product or service can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.
*   **3.2.1.2 Accessibility**: extent to which products, systems, services, environments and facilities can be used by people from a population with the widest range of user needs, characteristics and capabilities to achieve identified goals in identified contexts of use.
*   **3.2.1.3 Suitability**: extent to which behaviours or outcomes, or both, of a product meet (satisfy) specified quality requirements when used.

### 3.2.2 Freedom from Risk

*   **3.2.2.1 Freedom from economic risk**: extent to which a product or system mitigates the potential risk to financial status, efficient operation, commercial property, reputation, or other aspects in the intended contexts of use.
*   **3.2.2.2 Freedom from environmental and societal risk**: extent to which a product or system mitigates the potential risk to the environment and society at large in the intended contexts of use.
*   **3.2.2.3 Freedom from health risk**: extent to which a product or system mitigates the potential risk to people’s health in the intended contexts of use.
*   **3.2.2.4 Freedom from human life risk**: extent to which a product or system mitigates the potential risk to people’s lives in the intended contexts of use.

### 3.2.3 Acceptability

*   **3.2.3.1 Experience**: extent to which users or stakeholders accumulate knowledge or skill acquired over time, especially that gained in a particular profession.
*   **3.2.3.2 Trustworthiness**: extent to which users or stakeholders have confidence that their expectations are met in a verifiable way.
*   **3.2.3.3 Compliance**: extent to which a user or other stakeholder has confidence that a product, system, software, or service in use meets requirements, as required by rules or laws.
