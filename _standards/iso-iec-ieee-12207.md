## ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 - Systems and Software Engineering — Software Life Cycle Processes

ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 establishes a comprehensive framework for software life cycle processes, providing a common language and structure for software development, operation, and maintenance activities. The standard defines processes, activities, and tasks that apply during the acquisition, development, operation, maintenance, and disposal of software systems.

This standard serves as the foundation for software process improvement, project management, and quality assurance across the software lifecycle. It provides a process architecture that supports various software development methodologies, from traditional waterfall to agile and iterative approaches, while ensuring systematic management of software quality attributes.

## Software Life Cycle Process Framework

The standard organizes software lifecycle activities into several key process categories:

| Process Category | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| **Agreement Processes** | Processes for establishing agreements between organizations, including acquisition, supply, and customer-supplier agreements. |
| **Organizational Project-Enabling Processes** | Processes that provide resources and infrastructure for project execution, including life cycle model management, infrastructure management, and human resource management. |
| **Technical Management Processes** | Processes for managing technical aspects of projects, including project planning, assessment, control, decision management, risk management, and configuration management. |
| **Technical Processes** | Core technical processes for system/software development including stakeholder requirements definition, requirements analysis, architectural design, implementation, integration, verification, validation, operation, maintenance, and disposal. |

## Quality Attributes Emphasized by the Standard

The standard directly supports quality achievement through systematic process management:

| Quality Attribute | Relevance in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 |
|:--- |:--- |
| **[Process Quality](/qualities/process-quality)** | Systematic framework for defining, implementing, and improving software lifecycle processes to ensure consistent quality outcomes. |
| **[Traceability](/qualities/traceability)** | Requirements for maintaining traceability between lifecycle artifacts, decisions, and deliverables throughout the software lifecycle. |
| **[Maintainability](/qualities/maintainability)** | Explicit processes for software maintenance, including corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance activities. |
| **[Reliability](/qualities/reliability)** | Verification and validation processes ensure software meets reliability requirements through systematic testing and quality assurance. |
| **[Configuration Management](/qualities/configuration-management)** | Comprehensive configuration management processes for controlling changes and maintaining software integrity. |
| **[Risk Management](/qualities/risk-management)** | Systematic risk management processes for identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and treating software project risks. |
| **[Quality Assurance](/qualities/quality-assurance)** | Quality assurance processes embedded throughout the lifecycle to ensure adherence to standards and achievement of quality objectives. |
| **[Documentation](/qualities/documentation)** | Systematic documentation processes ensuring comprehensive recording of decisions, designs, and deliverables. |
| **[Verification](/qualities/verification)** | Systematic verification processes to confirm that software products meet their specified requirements. |
| **[Validation](/qualities/validation)** | Validation processes to ensure software meets stakeholder needs and intended use in operational environment. |

## Process Architecture and Structure
