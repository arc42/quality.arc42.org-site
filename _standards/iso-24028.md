## ISO/IEC TR 24028:2020: Overview of trustworthiness in artificial intelligence

ISO/IEC TR 24028:2020 "Overview of trustworthiness in artificial intelligence" is a foundational Technical Report that provides a comprehensive framework for understanding trustworthiness in AI systems. Published in May 2020 by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 (Artificial Intelligence), this document serves as a cornerstone for the international AI standards landscape, establishing a shared vocabulary and conceptual foundation for evaluating whether AI-enabled systems can be trusted.

The standard defines trustworthiness as **"the ability to meet stakeholders' expectations in a verifiable way"** and catalogs the key properties that contribute to building and maintaining trust in AI systems throughout their lifecycle.

### Role in the AI Standards Ecosystem

ISO/IEC TR 24028 plays a critical role within the broader ISO/IEC AI standards framework:

## Structure and Organization

ISO/IEC TR 24028:2020 comprises **10 clauses** and **1 annex**:

### Key Clauses

**Clause 1: Scope**
Defines the boundaries of the technical report and its intended use in surveying trustworthiness topics for AI systems.

**Clause 4: Overview**
Provides contextual background on AI systems and trustworthiness considerations, establishing the conceptual foundation for subsequent clauses.

**Clause 5: Existing Frameworks Applicable to Trustworthiness**
Surveys approaches from traditional systems engineering and other technical domains, evaluating their applicability to AI systems. Discusses strengths and limitations of established assurance frameworks when applied to machine learning and data-driven AI.

**Clause 6: Stakeholders**
Identifies key stakeholder groups with interests in AI system trustworthiness: developers, deployers, users, operators, regulators, and affected persons. Recognizes that different stakeholders have distinct trustworthiness expectations and requirements.

**Clause 7: Recognition of High-Level Concerns**
Examines considerations related to **responsibility, accountability, governance, and safety** of AI systems. Emphasizes the importance of governance frameworks that clearly define responsibilities and accountability chains among stakeholders.

**Clause 8: Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Challenges**
Catalogs AI-specific vulnerabilities that can reduce trustworthiness:
- **Data-related threats**: Bias in training data, data poisoning attacks, distribution shift between training and deployment
- **Model-related threats**: Adversarial examples, model extraction, membership inference attacks
- **Deployment threats**: Concept drift, environmental variations, integration vulnerabilities
- **Societal challenges**: Unintended consequences, fairness issues, lack of transparency

**Clause 9: Mitigation Measures**
Identifies practical approaches to improve AI system trustworthiness:
- **Development practices**: Rigorous data quality management, diverse training data, validation and testing protocols
- **Assurance techniques**: Robustness testing, adversarial probing, fairness audits, safety analysis
- **Operational controls**: Monitoring and logging, human oversight, fallback mechanisms, incident response
- **Governance mechanisms**: Clear accountability structures, ethical guidelines, stakeholder engagement

**Clause 10: Conclusions**
Synthesizes findings and highlights the multi-faceted nature of AI trustworthiness, emphasizing that no single property or technique suffices; trustworthiness requires holistic attention across technical, governance, and societal dimensions.

**Annex A (Informative): Related Work on Societal Issues**
Surveys relevant work addressing broader societal considerations of AI systems beyond purely technical aspects.

## AI-Specific Trustworthiness Challenges

ISO/IEC TR 24028 recognizes that AI systems, particularly those based on machine learning, face unique trustworthiness challenges distinct from traditional software:

### Data Dependencies

**Training Data Quality**: AI system behavior is fundamentally shaped by training data; biased, incomplete, or poisoned data directly compromises trustworthiness.

**Distribution Shift**: AI systems may fail when deployment conditions differ from training conditions, requiring ongoing monitoring and adaptation.

### Opacity and Explainability

**Black-Box Nature**: Deep learning models often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand why specific outputs were produced or to predict behavior in novel situations.

**Debugging Complexity**: Traditional debugging approaches are insufficient for diagnosing AI system failures, which may stem from subtle patterns in data rather than explicit code errors.

### Adversarial Vulnerabilities

**Adversarial Examples**: Carefully crafted inputs can cause AI systems to produce incorrect outputs with high confidence, representing a unique attack surface.

**Arms Race**: The continuous cycle of new adversarial attacks and defenses creates ongoing security challenges without definitive solutions.

### Emergent Behavior

**Unintended Consequences**: AI systems may learn unintended strategies or exhibit behaviors not anticipated during development, requiring extensive testing and monitoring.

**Societal Impact**: AI systems can have far-reaching societal effects including fairness issues, job displacement, and shifts in decision-making authority.
