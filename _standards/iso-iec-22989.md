## ISO/IEC 22989: Artificial intelligence — concepts and terminology

ISO/IEC 22989:2022 establishes a common vocabulary for artificial intelligence (AI). It defines core concepts and terms for AI systems, data, lifecycle stages, roles, and AI properties, to enable consistent communication across stakeholders and to underpin other AI standards from ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42.

### Scope and intent
- Defines foundational AI concepts (e.g., AI system, model, algorithm, dataset; training/validation/testing data; lifecycle; deployment and operation)
- Clarifies human roles and oversight (human-in-the-loop/on-the-loop/over-the-loop) and organizational responsibilities
- Introduces terminology for key AI properties such as transparency, explainability, robustness, reliability, resilience, safety, security, privacy, and risk
- Serves as a reference for related AI standards (risk management, trustworthiness, management systems, data quality, testing)

### Position in the SC 42 family
- Terminology baseline used by:
  - ISO/IEC 23894 — AI risk management
  - ISO/IEC 23053 — Framework for AI systems using machine learning
  - ISO/IEC 42001 — Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS)
  - ISO/IEC 24028 — Overview of trustworthiness in AI
  - ISO/IEC 5259 (series) — Data quality for analytics and ML
  - ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-11 — Testing of AI-based systems
