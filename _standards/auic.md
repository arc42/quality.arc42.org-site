## AIUC-1: The world's first AI agent standard

AIUC-1 is the world's first AI agent standard, designed to facilitate enterprise adoption of AI. It provides a framework for addressing the risks associated with AI agents, similar to the role of SOC 2 for service organizations.

## Core Principles

The standard is built around six core principles:

| Principle | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| **Data & Privacy** | Ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and privacy of data handled by AI agents. |
| **Security** | Protects against vulnerabilities and unauthorized access, ensuring the agent operates securely. |
| **Safety** | Prevents unintended and harmful actions, with robust controls and fail-safes. |
| **Reliability** | Ensures agents behave predictably and consistently, with proper error handling and recovery. |
| **Accountability** | Provides clear audit trails, logging, and human oversight for all agent actions. |
| **Society** | Aligns agent behavior with broader societal norms, ethics, and regulatory requirements. |

## Relationship to Quality Attributes

AIUC-1 directly addresses key quality attributes for enterprise systems, including:

* **Security**: A core principle of the standard.
* **Safety**: A core principle of the standard.
* **Reliability**: A core principle of the standard.
* **Accountability**: A core principle of the standard.
* **Data & Privacy**: A core principle of the standard.

It also indirectly influences other attributes like maintainability, portability, and interoperability by promoting a structured and well-governed approach to AI agent development and operation.
