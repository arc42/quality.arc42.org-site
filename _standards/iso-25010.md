## ISO/IEC 25010: Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE)

It defines a product quality model which is composed of nine characteristics, that correspond to our _tags_:

{% capture site_tags %}{% for tag in site.tags %}{{ tag | first }}{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}{% endfor %}{% endcapture %}
{% assign tag_words = site_tags |  split:',' | sort %}
{% assign tag_words_unique = tag_words | uniq %}
{% assign site_tags = tag_words_unique | join: ',' %}

{% for tag in tag_words_unique %}{{ tag }}, {% endfor %}
