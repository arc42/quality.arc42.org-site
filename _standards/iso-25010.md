## ISO/IEC 25010: Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE)

It defines a quality-in-use model and a product quality model. 
The product quality model is composed of nine characteristics.


These characteristics correspond somewhat to our _tags_:

{% capture site_tags %}{% for tag in site.tags %}{{ tag | first }}{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}{% endfor %}{% endcapture %}
{% assign tag_words = site_tags |  split:',' | sort %}
{% assign tag_words_unique = tag_words | uniq %}
{% assign site_tags = tag_words_unique | join: ',' %}

{% for tag in tag_words_unique %}{{ tag }}, {% endfor %}


## Product Quality Model Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| **[Functional Suitability](qualities/functional-suitability)** | The degree to which a product or system provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions. |
| **[Performance Efficiency](/qualities/performance-efficiency)** | The performance relative to the amount of resources used under stated conditions. |
| **[Compatibility](/qualities/compatibility)** | The degree to which a product, system or component can exchange information with other products, systems or components, and/or perform its required functions, while sharing the same hardware or software environment. |
| **[Interaction Capability](/qualities/interaction-capability)** | The degree to which a product or system can be operated by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. (Formerly Usability) |
| **[Reliability](/qualities/reliability)** | The degree to which a system, product or component performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time. |
| **[Security](/qualities/security)** | The degree to which a product or system protects information and data so that persons or other products or systems have the degree of data access appropriate to their types and levels of authorization. |
| **[Maintainability](/qualities/maintainability)** | The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be modified by the intended maintainers. |
| **[Flexibility](/qualities/flexibility)** | The degree to which a product or system can be adapted for different or evolving hardware, software or other operational or usage environments. (Formerly Portability) |
| **[Safety](/qualities/safety)** | The degree to which a product or system avoids harm to people, business, software, property or the environment in a specified context of use. |
