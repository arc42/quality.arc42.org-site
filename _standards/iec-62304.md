## IEC 62304: "Medical device software – Software life cycle processes"

This international standard defines the requirements for the software development life cycle of medical device software, whether the software is a component of a medical device or a standalone product (also known as Software as a Medical Device, SaMD).

## Quality Attributes Required or Emphasized

The standard does not explicitly use the term "quality attributes" in the ISO 25010 sense, but several critical attributes are clearly **emphasized through required processes**:

| Attribute | Relevance in IEC 62304 |
|:--- |:--- |
| **[Safety](/qualities/safety)** | Central concern. Risk management must be integrated throughout the software lifecycle. |
| **[Reliability](/qualities/reliability)** | Required via verification, validation, and robust maintenance processes. |
| **[Maintainability](/qualities/maintainability)** | Emphasis on change control, problem resolution, and proper documentation. |
| **[Traceability](/qualities/traceability)** | End-to-end traceability between requirements, implementation, tests, and risk controls. |
| **[Usability](/qualities/usability)** | Not a core focus, but indirectly relevant for safety and effectiveness. |
| **[Security](/qualities/security)** | Not directly addressed in depth (older version), but relevant under risk control. |

**Note:** The latest version of the standard encourages integration with ISO 14971 (Risk Management) and IEC 62366 (Usability Engineering) for comprehensive coverage.
