## ISO/IEC 25019: Systems and software engineering — Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) — Quality-in-use model

This standard, published in November 2023, defines a quality-in-use model. It is part of the SQuaRE (Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation) series of standards. 

Quality-in-use is the effect of a system's usage, the outcome of the interaction with a system. It is the user's view of quality.

ISO/IEC 25019:2023 replaces the quality-in-use model that was previously part of ISO/IEC 25010:2011.

## Quality-in-use Model Characteristics

The quality-in-use model is composed of three characteristics:

| Characteristic | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| **Beneficialness** | The degree to which a product or system provides benefits to stakeholders in a specified context of use. |
| **Freedom from Risk** | The degree to which a product or system mitigates the potential risk to economic status, human life, health, or the environment. |
| **Acceptability** | The degree to which a product or system is accepted by its stakeholders in a specified context of use. |
