## ISO/IEC 5055: Information technology — Software measurement — Software quality measurement — Automated source code quality measures

ISO/IEC 5055 defines four automated source code quality measures derived from detecting and counting severe weaknesses in source code that impact key quality characteristics. The measures are intended to be language-independent and applicable across application and embedded domains. They were standardized internationally to provide a consistent basis for specifying, assessing, and contracting for internal software quality at the code level.

This standard is aligned with the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model and quantifies four characteristics via rule-based detection of weaknesses defined in the OMG Automated Source Code Quality Measures (ASCQM) specification.

### Provenance

Prepared by the Object Management Group as ASCQM and adopted under the ISO/IEC JTC 1 PAS process; national foreword and scope details are publicly visible via BSI Knowledge.

## Quality Attributes Required or Emphasized

|| Attribute | Relevance in ISO/IEC 5055 |
||:--- |:--- |
|| **[Reliability](/qualities/reliability)** | Counts weaknesses that could cause faults at runtime or lead to system failure, thereby degrading dependable behavior. |
|| **[Security](/qualities/security)** | Counts weaknesses that introduce vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers, reducing protection of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. |
|| **[Performance Efficiency](/qualities/performance-efficiency)** | Counts weaknesses that produce excessive resource consumption or latency under stated conditions. |
|| **[Maintainability](/qualities/maintainability)** | Counts weaknesses that make the code harder, riskier, or costlier to modify, test, or understand, thus impeding efficient evolution. |

### Notes
- ISO/IEC 5055 operationalizes internal quality at the source-code level through measurable rule violations. Implementations typically provide language-specific rule sets consistent with the OMG ASCQM specification, enabling aggregation per quality characteristic.
