ISO/IEC 5055 defines four automated source code quality measures derived from detecting and counting severe weaknesses in source code that impact key quality characteristics. 
ISO/IEC 5055 operationalizes internal quality at the source-code level through measurable rule violations. 

These measures are intended to be language-independent and applicable across application and embedded domains. 
They were standardized internationally to provide a consistent basis for specifying, assessing, and contracting for internal software quality at the code level.
Implementations of this standard typically provide language-specific rule sets consistent with the OMG ASCQM specification, enabling aggregation per quality characteristic.

This standard is aligned with the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model and quantifies four characteristics via rule-based detection of weaknesses defined in the OMG Automated Source Code Quality Measures (ASCQM) specification.

## Quality Attributes Required or Emphasized

| Attribute | Relevance in ISO/IEC 5055 |
|:--- |:--- |
| **[Reliability](/qualities/reliability)** | Counts weaknesses that could cause faults at runtime or lead to system failure, thereby degrading dependable behavior. |
| **[Security](/qualities/security)** | Counts weaknesses that introduce vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers, reducing protection of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. |
| **[Performance Efficiency](/qualities/performance-efficiency)** | Counts weaknesses that produce excessive resource consumption or latency under stated conditions. |
| **[Maintainability](/qualities/maintainability)** | Counts weaknesses that make the code harder, riskier, or costlier to modify, test, or understand, thus impeding efficient evolution. |
