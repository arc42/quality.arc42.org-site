## ISO/IEC 15408: Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation

Also known as the Common Criteria (CC), this standard provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the security features and capabilities of IT products and systems. 
Its primary goal is to ensure that IT products are specified, implemented, and evaluated in a consistent and repeatable manner, providing confidence in their security.

The Common Criteria was developed by national security organizations from the United States, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. 
The [Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA)](https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/ccra/) ensures that signatory countries recognize the results of evaluations performed by other members, reducing the need for multiple certifications.

### Key Concepts

The Common Criteria framework is built around several key components:

| Term | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| **Protection Profile (PP)** | Defines a set of security requirements for a specific category of products (e.g., firewalls, operating systems). |
| **Security Target (ST)** | Prepared by the product vendor, it specifies the security functions and assurance requirements of a particular product, known as the Target of Evaluation (TOE). |
| **Security Functional Requirements (SFRs)** | Specific security functions that a product must provide, such as user authentication or data encryption. The Common Criteria provides a standardized catalog of these functions. |
| **Security Assurance Requirements (SARs)** | Measures taken during development and evaluation to ensure that security functions are implemented correctly. |
| **Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL)** | A rating from EAL1 (functionally tested) to EAL7 (formally verified design and tested) that measures the depth and rigor of the evaluation process. A higher EAL indicates a more thorough evaluation but does not necessarily mean the product is inherently more secure. |

### Quality Attributes

The Common Criteria addresses a broad range of security-related quality attributes. These can be grouped into three main categories:

*   **Core Security (CIA Triad):**
    *   [Security](/qualities/security): The protection of assets from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
    *   [Confidentiality](/qualities/confidentiality): Ensuring that information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.
    *   [Integrity](/qualities/integrity): Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle.
    *   [Availability](/qualities/availability): Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required.

*   **Assurance Requirements:**
    *   [Authenticity](/qualities/authenticity): Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device.
    *   [Auditability](/qualities/auditability): The ability to create and maintain a record of system activities.
    *   [Traceability](/qualities/traceability): The ability to trace actions to their source.
    *   [Testability](/qualities/testability): The degree to which a system or component can be tested.

*   **Evaluation Outcomes:**
    *   [Compliance](/qualities/compliance): Adherence to a set of standards, policies, or regulations.
    *   [Reliability](/qualities/reliability): The ability of a system to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period.

### Evaluation Process

1.  **Security Target Preparation:** The vendor creates a Security Target document detailing the product\'s security features and the desired EAL.
2.  **Laboratory Evaluation:** An accredited independent testing laboratory evaluates the product against the claims made in the Security Target.
3.  **Certification Issuance:** If the evaluation is successful, the product receives Common Criteria certification.

In the United States, the [National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP)](https://www.niap-ccevs.org/) administers the Common Criteria program.
