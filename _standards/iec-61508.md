## IEC 61508: Functional safety (generic, cross-industry)

IEC 61508 is the foundational international standard for achieving functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic (E/E/PE) safety‑related systems. 
It defines a risk‑based safety lifecycle, Safety Integrity Levels (SIL 1–4), and requirements spanning management, system/hardware, and software to reduce risks to an acceptable level.

It serves as the generic base for many sector standards (e.g., road vehicles, medical devices, process industry) and is often applied when no dedicated domain standard exists.

### Scope and core concepts (at a glance)
- Risk‑based approach with target risk reduction expressed via SIL 1–4.
- End‑to‑end safety lifecycle from concept, hazard and risk analysis, allocation, development, integration, operation, maintenance to decommissioning.
- Requirements for management of functional safety, competence, independence, verification & validation, configuration and change management.
- Hardware topics: architectural constraints, diagnostic coverage, Safe Failure Fraction (SFF), Hardware Fault Tolerance (HFT), systematic capability.
- Software topics: software safety lifecycle, techniques/measures by SIL, verification, validation, tool qualification, proven‑in‑use.

### Why it matters for qualities
- Primary qualities: safety, reliability.
- Supports operability and maintainability through lifecycle rigor, traceability, and change control.
