<div class="arc42-help" markdown="1">

* Resource-efficient, fast, low-footprint, low latency.
* Energy-, storage- and network efficient, having adequate capacity
* Development-efficient, being easy to change (although that aspect may better be covered by [#flexible](/tag-flexible))
* Time-to-market, how efficient new features can _go live_

### Definitions


>capable of producing desired results with little or no waste (as of time or materials) 
>
>[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/efficient)

<hr>

> The amount of computing resources and code required by a program to perform a function.

### Effective vs Efficient

>The words effective and efficient both mean "capable of producing a result," but there is an important difference. Effective means "producing a result that is wanted". Efficient means "capable of producing desired results without wasting materials, time, or energy".
>The difference is that when something is effective it produces a result even if it takes some unnecessary resources to do so. When something is efficient, not only does it produce a result, but it does so in a quick or simple way using as little material, time, effort, or energy as possible. The following example sentences show how the two words are used.
>* The 200-page instruction manual was effective (_=successful_) in teaching the teen to repair the car himself, but it would have been more efficient (_=faster and easier_) for someone to show him.
>* His disorganized method of cleaning the house was effective but it was not efficient; in the end, the house was clean, but it took much longer than it should have.
>
>The word _effective_ puts more attention on the actual ability to produce a desired result. The word _efficient_ puts more attention on the lack of waste in producing that result.

## Typical Acceptance Criteria

Efficient, as we saw above, can mean several different things:

* efficient at runtime, like defined by specific time behavior, resource consumption (e.g. energy, memory, processes, threads, network) or capacity (throughput, volume processed)
* efficient to change or modify something within the system or its infrastructure
* efficient concerning energy or CO2 consumption
* efficient development processes, like short time-to-market

### Scenario Response Measures from [Bass et al.]

>* The (maximum, medium, mean median) time the response takes ([[latency](/qualities/latency)])
>* The number or percentage of satisfied requests over some time interval (throughput) or set of events received
>* The number or percentage of requests that go unsatisfied
>* The variation in response time ([jitter](/qualities/jitter))
>* Usage level of a computing resource

### What Stakeholders (might) mean by _efficient_

| Stakeholder | (potential) Expectation for _efficient_ |
|:--- |:--- |
| User |* system produces desired results quickly<br>* can achieve desired results with low effort, e.g. only a few keystrokes<br>* system reacts immediately to commands<br>* low-energy consumption, e.g. long battery life |
| Product-Owner |* dev-team can implement new features quickly |
| Management |* high return on investment<br>  |
| Developer |* new features can be implemented quickly<br>* build works quickly<br>* automated tests run quickly  |
| Tester |* tests run quickly<br>* automated tests find relevant bugs<br>* test infrastructure works with appropriate resources |
| Admin |* fast deployment, installation and configuration   |
