## Typical Acceptance Criteria


>* Time or time interval when the system shall be available
>* Availability percentage
>* Time to detect a fault
>* Time to repair a fault
>* Time or time interval in which the system may operate in degraded mode
>* Proportion (e.g. 99%) or rate (e.g. up to 42 per second) of a certain class or types of faults that the system either prevents or handles without failing

### What  Stakeholders mean by _reliable_


| Stakeholder | (potential) Expectation for _reliable_ |
|:--- |:--- |
| User |* available when need it<br>* produces expected results<br>* offers expected functionality<br>* user documentation is reliable |
| Product-Owner |* realiably add new functions and features<br>* reliable estimates concerning effort for changes<br>* reliable at runtime, available when users need it |
| Management | * cost and effort of development, operations and support are reliably predictable<br>* reliable with respect to operations, especially security and interoperability |
| Developer |* reliably add new features or functions to the system without unwanted side-effects.<br>* realiably predict the effects of changes to the system  |
| Tester |test results are reliable (as in _consistent_ or _repeatable_) |
| Admin | * _reliably_ start, configure and monitor the system<br> * reliable release and update processes  |
| Domain-Expert | - |
| Others | * technical documentation is reliable (current and correct)  |
