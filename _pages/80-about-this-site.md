## Tooling

* This page is based upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static website generator, using a modified version of the [Ttskch](https://github.com/ttskch/jekyll-ttskch-theme) theme.
* It's maintained on [Github](https://github.com/arc42/quality.arc42.org-site/) and published via github-pages.
* A [Docker container](https://github.com/BretFisher/jekyll-serve) provided by Bret E. Fisher for local build- and test of the site (`docker compose up` after cloning the repo locally).
