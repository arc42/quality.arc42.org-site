* bring into a new or modified execution environment (e.g. new hardware, operating system or cloud provider)
* handle changed workload
  

</div>

### Definition

>Capability of a product to be adapted to changes in its requirements, contexts of use, or system environment.
> 
>Note: Flexibility to context of use should consider two distinguished aspects, i.e. technical and non-technical. The technical aspect is related with the execution environment of products, such as software, hardware and communication facility; and the non-technical aspect is related with the social environment, such as user and task, and the physical environment, such as climate and nature.

## Typical Acceptance Criteria

Flexible, as we saw above, means "_adaptable to change_".

When defining what exactly _#flexible_ shall mean for a specific system and specific stakeholders, we need to consider the following questions:

* what type of change (e.g. changed functionality, changed quality requirements, changed workload, changed infrastructure) 
* when does this change occur or when do people want to respond to the changes: at development-, compile/build-, installation-, startup- or runtime?

Typical acceptance criteria might include:

* Effort or number/types of changed artifacts to handle changes 
* Time or money spent for such changes 
* Side-effects on other system properties


### Scenario Response Measures from [Bass et al.]
>Cost in terms of
>
>* Number, size, complexity of affected artifacts
>* Effort
>* Elapsed time
>* Money
>* Extent to which this modification affects other quality attributes
>* New defects introduced
