_Suitable_ might be the most generic term within the Q42 properties.

<div class="arc42-help" markdown="1">

Being right or appropriate for a particular person, purpose, or situation.
</div><br>

Note: In previous versions of Q42, the term "_testable_" was used instead of _suitable_.
Users found that to be overly specific, see the discussion [here](https://github.com/arc42/quality.arc42.org-site/issues/90).


## Definition

>(Functional) Suitability:
>
>...provides functions that meet stated and implied needs of intended users when it is used under specified conditions.
>
>[ISO-25010:2023](/references/#iso-25010-2023)

The ISO restricts _Suitability_ to functional aspects. 
In our opinion, it is useful in a broader sense: For example, seen from a testing perspective, suitable can mean "easy to test". 

### "Responsibility" as an alternative term

[Bass et al., 2021](/references/#bass2021software) propose to use the term "responsibility" instead of (functional) suitability.
That is, from our perspective, a matter of taste.
