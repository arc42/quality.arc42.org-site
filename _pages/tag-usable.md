<div class="arc42-help" markdown="1">

The main idea of _usability_ is that a system shall be designed with (generalized) users' psychology and physiology in mind, to make that system:

*  more efficient to use, so it takes less time to accomplish particular tasks
*  easier to learn
*  more satisfying to use

### Definitions:

>Capability of a product to be interacted with by specified users to exchange information between a user and a system via the user interface to complete the intended task.
>[ISO-25010:2023](/references/#iso-25010-2023)

<hr class="with-no-margin"/>

>The capacity of a system to provide a condition for its users to perform the tasks safely, effectively, and efficiently while enjoying the experience.
>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability)


<hr class="with-no-margin"/>

>Enable users to perform their tasks safely, effectively and efficiently while enjoying the experience.

## Typical Acceptance Criteria

<!--TODO -->

### Scenario Response Measures from [Bass et al.]

>The system should:
>
>* provide the user with the features needed
>* anticipate the user's needs
>* provide appropriate feedback to the user
>
>The system's response might be  measured in one or more of the following:
>
>* task time
>* number of errors
>* learning time
>* ratio of learning time to task time
>* number of tasks accomplished
>* user satisfaction
>* gain of user knowledge
>* ratio of successful operations to total operations
>* amount of time or data lost when an error occurs
