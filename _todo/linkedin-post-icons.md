ðŸŽ¯ **Visual Design Update for quality.arc42.org**

I've just finalized the icon system for our quality attributes knowledge base, which now covers 170+ software quality attributes with practical requirements and standards.

**Why these specific icons?**

ðŸ’Ž **Gem (Qualities)**: Quality attributes are like precious gems - multifaceted, valuable, and each one reveals different aspects of system excellence when examined from various angles.

ðŸŽ¯ **Bullseye (Requirements)**: Quality requirements need precision. They're specific, measurable targets that teams must hit to achieve the desired quality outcomes.

ðŸ“œ **Certificate (Standards)**: Official quality standards like ISO 25010 represent formal recognition and established benchmarks in our field.

ðŸ§© **Puzzle Piece (Approaches)**: Patterns, practices, and tactics are solution components that fit together. No single approach solves everything - they work in combination.

These visual cues help architects and developers quickly navigate between different types of quality-related content, making the 170+ quality attributes more accessible and actionable.

The goal? Making software quality less abstract and more practical for development teams.
