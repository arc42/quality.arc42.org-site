# Quality Attributes Addressed by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 (Software Testing)

## Directly addressed (strong testing-process linkage)

- **testability** - Core objective of the series: define test processes, techniques, and work products.
- **verifiability** - Explicit focus on producing objective verification evidence.
- **traceability** - Test basis, design, execution, and reporting are linked through defined artifacts.
- **reproducibility** - Standardized test documentation and execution practices improve repeatable outcomes.
- **auditability** - Structured records and reports support assessment, audit, and certification activities.
- **correctness** - Testing compares observed behavior against expected results to detect defects and deviations.

## Indirectly addressed (enabled by systematic testing)

- **reliability** - Broader and more systematic testing increases confidence in stable system behavior.
- **maintainability** - Regression assets and standardized test documentation support safer evolution.
- **compliance** - Test evidence supports contractual, regulatory, and internal governance obligations.
- **security** - Security-related tests can be integrated consistently into the standardized test process.
- **performance** - Performance and other non-functional tests are supported by standardized planning and reporting.
