# PCI-DSS Quality Attributes

This document lists quality attributes that are directly or indirectly addressed by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

## Primary Quality Attributes (Directly Required)

### Security-focused Attributes

- **security** - Core focus of the entire standard
- **confidentiality** - Protection of sensitive cardholder data
- **integrity** - Ensuring data remains unaltered and authentic
- **availability** - Maintaining operational payment systems
- **non-repudiation** - Audit trails for transaction accountability

### Access and Authentication

- **access-control** - Strict need-to-know access restrictions
- **authenticity** - User and system authentication requirements
- **accountability** - Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Secondary Quality Attributes (Indirectly Supported)

### System Management

- **auditability** - Extensive logging and monitoring requirements
- **traceability** - Detailed audit trails for compliance
- **monitoring** - Continuous surveillance of cardholder data environment
- **vulnerability-management** - Regular security testing and scanning

### Operational Attributes

- **compliance** - Adherence to regulatory requirements
- **reliability** - Dependable payment processing systems
- **resilience** - Recovery from security incidents
- **maintainability** - System updates and security patches

### Risk Management

- **risk-identification** - Regular risk assessments required
- **recoverability** - Business continuity planning
- **resistance** - Protection against malicious attacks
- **robustness** - Withstanding various threat scenarios

## Network and Infrastructure Attributes

### Network Security

- **network-security** - Firewall and network segmentation requirements
- **encryption** - Data protection in transit and at rest
- **isolation** - Network segmentation of cardholder data environment

### System Hardening

- **configurability** - Secure system configuration requirements
- **changeability** - Controlled change management processes
- **testability** - Regular security testing and penetration testing

## Process and Governance Attributes

### Organizational Security

- **policy-compliance** - Information security policy requirements
- **training-effectiveness** - Security awareness training
- **incident-response** - Security incident handling procedures
- **vendor-management** - Third-party service provider oversight

### Documentation and Reporting

- **documentation-quality** - Comprehensive documentation requirements
- **reporting-accuracy** - Compliance reporting and validation
- **process-maturity** - Structured security management processes

## Notes

1. **Primary attributes** are explicitly required by PCI DSS requirements and are central to compliance
2. **Secondary attributes** support the primary security objectives and may be necessary to achieve compliance
3. This list reflects PCI DSS v4.0.1 requirements and may evolve with future standard updates
4. Some attributes may overlap or be interdependent in the context of payment security

## Related Standards Integration

PCI DSS quality attributes often align with other security standards:

- ISO 27001 information security management
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 25010 security characteristics
