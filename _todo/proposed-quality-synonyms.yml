# Proposed Quality Synonyms for arc42 Quality Model
# Format: canonical-slug: [synonym1, synonym2, ...]
#
# Confidence levels:
# ✅ HIGH - Explicit duplicates, interchangeable in all contexts
# ⚠️ MEDIUM - Very similar, but slight contextual differences
# ❓ LOW - Related but potentially distinct, needs discussion
#
# Decision criteria:
# - Same definition across all uses
# - Interchangeable without semantic loss
# - No meaningful distinction for users

# ========================================
# HIGH CONFIDENCE - Recommend implementing first
# ========================================

# Time-related (both files explicitly call each other synonyms)
time-to-market:
  - speed-to-market

# Performance (performance-efficiency file says it's a duplicate)
performance:
  - performance-efficiency

# Availability (high-availability file says "synonym for availability")
availability:
  - high-availability

# Changeability (changeability file says "Synonym: Mutability")
changeability:
  - mutability


# ========================================
# MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - Needs review/discussion
# ========================================

# Security variants
# Note: information-security says "similar/synonym" but has more specific definition
# Recommendation: START as separate, consider merging after user feedback
# security:
#   - information-security  # ISO 27001 context, more specific
#   - cyber-security         # Digital/IT focus, more specific

# Readability variants
# Note: Both say "sometimes a synonym for understandability"
# Issue: readability ≠ legibility in typography (one is design, one is implementation)
# Recommendation: KEEP SEPARATE - subtle but real distinction
# readability:
#   - legibility  # Actually different: readability=comprehension, legibility=visual clarity


# ========================================
# LOW CONFIDENCE / DO NOT MERGE
# ========================================

# These are RELATED but DISTINCT concepts:
# - debuggability vs observability (debuggability file explicitly distinguishes them)
# - reliability vs dependability (dependability has broader scope per reliability.md)
# - maintainability vs modifiability (different aspects of changeability)
# - security vs cyber-security vs information-security (different scopes)
# - readability vs code-readability (general vs code-specific)
# - testability vs verifiability (different perspectives)


# ========================================
# POTENTIAL FUTURE CANDIDATES
# (Need deeper analysis of content)
# ========================================

# These pairs might be synonyms but need content review:
# - analysability vs analyzability (spelling variants? Check if both exist)
# - configurability vs customizability (might be distinct: config vs custom code)
# - reliability vs dependability (dependability explicitly says it's broader)
# - correctness vs accuracy (might have subtle differences)


# ========================================
# RECOMMENDATIONS
# ========================================

# Phase 1 (Week 1): Implement only HIGH CONFIDENCE synonyms
# - These have explicit "synonym" mentions in content
# - Clear duplicates with no semantic loss
# - Low risk, high confidence

# Phase 2 (Week 3): Evaluate MEDIUM CONFIDENCE after user feedback
# - security/* trio needs domain expert input
# - Consider keeping separate for SEO/standard-specific contexts

# Phase 3 (Ongoing): Monitor for new synonym candidates
# - Watch for user confusion in issues/feedback
# - Look for qualities consistently used together
# - Consider regional/language variants
