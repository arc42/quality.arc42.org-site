# PCI DSS â€“ Quality attributes addressed (directly/indirectly)

- Security
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability (indirectly via hardening, malware protection, monitoring/testing)
- Access control (least privilege, separation of duties)
- Authentication (MFA, identity management)
- Accountability (audit logging, monitoring, traceability)
- Non-repudiation (via attributable identities and logs; depends on implementation)
- Compliance (programmatic conformance evidence, assessments)
- Privacy (only insofar as payment account data protection overlaps; PCI DSS focuses on account data, not general personal data)
