# Quality Attributes for ISO/IEC TR 24028

This file lists quality attributes that are directly or indirectly addressed by the ISO/IEC TR 24028:2020 standard on "Overview of trustworthiness in artificial intelligence".

## Core Trustworthiness Properties (Directly Addressed)

These attributes are explicitly identified as trustworthiness dimensions in ISO/IEC TR 24028:

1. **reliability** - Consistent behavior under expected conditions
2. **robustness** - Graceful handling of noise, variability, and adversarial inputs
3. **safety** - Avoidance of unacceptable risk of harm
4. **security** - Resistance to tampering, fraud, and unauthorized access
5. **privacy** - Data protection and minimization of sensitive information exposure
6. **accountability** - Clear responsibility chains and decision evidence
7. **transparency** - Stakeholder understanding of system capabilities and limitations
8. **explainability** - Ability to provide comprehensible explanations for outputs
9. **fairness** - Avoidance of unjust bias and discriminatory impact
10. **accuracy** - Correctness of outputs relative to ground truth
11. **availability** - Operational readiness when needed
12. **resiliency** - Ability to recover from disruptions
13. **integrity** - Authenticity and completeness of data and models
14. **controllability** - Mechanisms to intervene or halt operations

## Related Quality Attributes (Indirectly Addressed)

These attributes are implied or supported by ISO/IEC TR 24028's guidance:

15. **testability** - Validation of AI system behavior through systematic testing
16. **maintainability** - Ongoing updates and monitoring to maintain trustworthiness
17. **compliance** - Adherence to AI-specific regulations and ethical guidelines
18. **auditability** - Capability to review and verify AI system decisions
19. **traceability** - Ability to track data lineage and decision provenance
20. **verifiability** - Capacity to verify that stakeholder expectations are met
21. **understandability** - Comprehensibility of AI system operation and outputs
22. **predictability** - Consistency and predictability of AI system behavior
23. **correctness** - Alignment of AI outputs with intended specifications
24. **responsiveness** - Timeliness of AI system responses and operations

## Governance and Process Attributes

These attributes relate to the governance and lifecycle management aspects covered in TR 24028:

25. **governability** - Effectiveness of governance frameworks for AI systems
26. **ethical-alignment** - Adherence to ethical principles in AI development and deployment
27. **stakeholder-trust** - Confidence of diverse stakeholders in the AI system
28. **risk-management** - Systematic identification and mitigation of AI-related risks

## AI-Specific Concerns

Attributes specifically relevant to machine learning and AI systems:

29. **data-quality** - Quality of training and operational data
30. **model-quality** - Robustness and accuracy of trained models
31. **bias-mitigation** - Measures to prevent and address algorithmic bias
32. **adversarial-resilience** - Resistance to adversarial attacks and manipulations
33. **drift-resistance** - Ability to handle distribution shift and concept drift

## Notes

- ISO/IEC TR 24028 is a Technical Report, not a certifiable standard, so it provides guidance and frameworks rather than specific requirements.
- The standard emphasizes that **trustworthiness is multi-faceted** and requires holistic attention across technical, governance, and societal dimensions.
- Many of these attributes are interrelated; for example, transparency supports accountability, and robustness contributes to reliability.
- The specific emphasis on each attribute may vary depending on the AI system's application domain and risk level.
