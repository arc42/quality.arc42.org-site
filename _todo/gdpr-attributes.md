- **consent-management** - Technical mechanisms for valid consent handling

### Transparency and Accountability
- **transparency** - Clear communication about data processing
- **accountability** - Demonstrable compliance and governance
- **auditability** - Comprehensive logging and compliance records
- **traceability** - Data lineage and processing activity tracking

### Security and Access Control
- **security** - Protection against breaches and unauthorized access
- **access-control** - Granular permissions and data subject rights
- **confidentiality** - Protection against unauthorized disclosure
- **authenticity** - Verification of data subjects and processing legitimacy

## Secondary Quality Attributes Indirectly Addressed

### System Design and Architecture
- **availability** - Ensuring data subject rights can be exercised
- **interoperability** - Data portability and standard format requirements
- **flexibility** - Adaptability to changing privacy requirements
- **maintainability** - Ongoing compliance and system updates

### Data Management
- **data-quality** - Accuracy and completeness requirements
