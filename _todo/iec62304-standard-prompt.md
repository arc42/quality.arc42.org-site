# Prompt for Creating a IEC-62304 Quality Standard Page

## Instructions

I have already described several quality standards (e.g., ISO 25010, ISO 26262, ISO 27001). Please help me to also cover **IEC-62304**.

The existing file `_standards/iec-62304.md` is just a placeholder and might contain erroneous information. Please thoroughly search the web for reliable and accurate sources and summarize them into a concise, one-page overview (similar in structure and tone to the existing standard pages).

In addition, please provide a list of quality attributes that are addressed (directly or indirectly) by the **IEC-62304** standard. Put these names into a new file named `_todo/iec62304-attributes.md`.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Review Existing Content:** First, carefully review the existing `_standards/iso-25010.md` and `_standards/iso-26262.md` files to understand and mirror its structure, tone, and level of detail for the new page.
2.  **Research:** Fetch authoritative and trustworthy sources about **IEC-62304** from the web.
3.  **Synthesize and Write:** Synthesize the gathered information into a concise one-page overview and update the existing `_standards/{{standard_filename}}.md` file accordingly.
4.  **Extract Attributes:** Create the `_todo/iec62304-attributes.md` file containing the list of quality attributes.
5. I strictly require Source Attribution. List the URLs of the primary sources it used to generate the content. Give me only verified URLs - all must be accessible and public. At the end of the updated `_standards/iec-62304.md` file, add a 'Sources' section listing the URLs of the authoritative web pages you used for your summary.

Think hardâ€”the correctness of all facts and links provided is crucial and highly important. Ask for clarification if you need additional information.
