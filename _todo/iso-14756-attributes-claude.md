# ISO/IEC 14756 Quality Attributes

This document lists the quality attributes directly or indirectly mentioned or covered by ISO/IEC 14756 "Measurement and rating of performance of computer-based software systems".

## Primary Quality Attributes

These attributes are explicitly defined and measured in the standard:

1. **Performance Efficiency** - The primary focus of the standard, measuring how efficiently a system performs under various conditions
2. **Time Behaviour** - Specifically measuring response times, processing times, and throughput rates
3. **Resource Utilization** - How efficiently the system uses hardware resources during operation
4. **Throughput** - The rate at which the system can process transactions or data
5. **Latency** - Delays in system response to user actions
6. **Capacity** - The system's ability to handle increasing workloads while maintaining acceptable performance

## Secondary Quality Attributes

These attributes are indirectly addressed or supported by the standard:

7. **Reliability** - Through consistent performance under specified conditions over time
8. **Usability** - Indirectly through response time measurements that affect user experience
9. **Efficiency** - Overall system efficiency in terms of resource usage and performance
10. **Scalability** - Implied through capacity measurements under varying loads
11. **Responsiveness** - User-perceived system response to interactions
12. **Stability** - Consistency of performance metrics over time

## Measurement Concepts

The standard introduces several important measurement concepts:

1. **User-oriented performance measurement** - Focusing on the user's experience rather than just technical metrics
2. **Representative operation profiles** - Defining realistic usage patterns for testing
3. **Statistical evaluation methods** - Frameworks for analyzing performance data
4. **Reproducible test environments** - Controlled testing conditions for reliable results
5. **Performance rating** - Methods to evaluate and compare system performance
