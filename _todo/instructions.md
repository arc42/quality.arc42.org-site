I need to amend the headers of several qualities (each described in its own file under the qualities subdirectory under _posts.)

## Required Changes

The existing header need to be enhanced by a single line,
`standards: iso25010`

For example, the current header of flexibility.md is:

---
title: Flexibility
tags: flexible
related: maintainability, modularity, adaptability, configurability, changeability, agility
permalink: /qualities/flexibility
---

After the change, it should look like this:

---
title: Flexibility
tags: flexible
related: maintainability, modularity, adaptability, configurability, changeability, agility

permalink: /qualities/flexibility
---
