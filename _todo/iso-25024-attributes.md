# ISO/IEC 25024 â€” Addressed Quality Attributes (data quality and related)

The standard focuses on measuring data quality. Attributes addressed directly (as data-quality dimensions) or indirectly (via related system qualities affecting data) include:

- Accuracy
- Completeness
- Consistency
- Credibility
- Currentness / Up-to-dateness
- Timeliness
- Precision
- Precision/Granularity adequacy
- Traceability (of data lineage)
- Availability (of data)
- Accessibility (authorized access to data)
- Integrity (data integrity)
- Confidentiality/Privacy (as it relates to data quality requirements and constraints)
- Compliance (regulatory and rule conformance of data)
- Recoverability/Restorability (of data)
- Portability/Interoperability (of data formats for quality evaluation across systems)
- Uniqueness/De-duplication
- Validity (conformance to domain rules/schemas)
- Understandability/Interpretability (metadata quality)
- Consistency of representation (format, units)
- Completeness of metadata
- Provenance/Lineage
- Reliability (of data as an asset; stability of values over time when expected)

Notes
- ISO/IEC 25024 operationalizes measurement for many of the characteristics defined in ISO/IEC 25012, which distinguishes inherent vs. system-dependent data quality. The above list consolidates common terms across both documents for planning and evaluation.
