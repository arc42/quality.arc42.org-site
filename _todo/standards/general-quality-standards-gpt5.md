# General quality standards (candidates)

These focus on inner qualities such as maintainability, modifiability, understandability, testability, and evidence/measurement, in the broad spirit of ISO/IEC 25010.

| Standard | Why pick this one |
|---|---|
| ISO 14971 (Risk Management for medical devices) | | 
| IEC 62366 (Usability Engineering) | |
| **SOX** | Financial data accuracy and audit requirements|
- **IEEE 2857** - Privacy engineering guidelines


| ISO/SAE 21434 (Road vehicles — Cybersecurity engineering) | Highly demanded in automotive; directly links to security, risk, and assurance qualities; complements ISO 26262 by addressing cyber risks; rich set of artifacts (TARA, CSMS) that map well to requirements examples |
| IEC 62443 series (Industrial automation and control systems security) | Dominant in OT/ICS; strong relevance for resilience, availability, and defense-in-depth; growing adoption beyond classic industrial domains; complements ISO 27001 with sector-specific controls |
| ISO 14971 (Medical devices — Risk management) | Central to safety-critical medical products; clear linkage to risk, safety, and evidence; complements IEC 62304 with process focus on hazards/harms; widely referenced by regulators |
| ISO/IEC 29119 (Software testing) | Comprehensive testing processes/techniques; maps to testability, coverage, and evidence qualities; offers structure for test artifacts and metrics |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 (Software life cycle processes) | Foundational process model for software; broad coverage of engineering and management processes; anchors many quality attributes (maintainability, reliability) across the lifecycle |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 (Systems life cycle processes) | Systems-level counterpart to 12207; enables end-to-end traceability, integration, and validation; supports cross-domain qualities and stakeholder views |
| ISO/IEC 27002 (Information security controls) | Practical complement to ISO 27001 already covered; concrete control catalog that maps to many qualities (confidentiality, integrity, availability) and requirements patterns |
