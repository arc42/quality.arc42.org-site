# General quality standards (candidates)

These focus on inner qualities such as maintainability, modifiability, understandability, testability, and evidence/measurement, in the broad spirit of ISO/IEC 25010.

| Standard | Why pick this one |
|---|---|
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 (Architecture description) | Establishes how to describe architectures with viewpoints and stakeholder concerns; improves understandability, consistency, and traceability—key drivers of maintainability and evolvability |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 42030:2019 (Architecture evaluation) | Guidance to evaluate architectures systematically; links design decisions to quality attributes (modifiability, performance, reliability) and supports early risk mitigation |

| ISO/IEC 25022:2016 (Measurement of quality in use) | Adds user-centric measures (effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction) that complement internal quality; helps balance internal “clean code” with external fitness |
| ISO/IEC 25024:2015 (Measurement of data quality) | Data correctness, completeness, and consistency are prerequisites for maintainable, explainable systems; offers concrete indicators for data-centric inner quality |
| ISO/SAE 21434 (Road vehicles — Cybersecurity engineering) | Highly demanded in automotive; directly links to security, risk, and assurance qualities; complements ISO 26262 by addressing cyber risks; rich set of artifacts (TARA, CSMS) that map well to requirements examples |
| IEC 62443 series (Industrial automation and control systems security) | Dominant in OT/ICS; strong relevance for resilience, availability, and defense-in-depth; growing adoption beyond classic industrial domains; complements ISO 27001 with sector-specific controls |
| ISO 14971 (Medical devices — Risk management) | Central to safety-critical medical products; clear linkage to risk, safety, and evidence; complements IEC 62304 with process focus on hazards/harms; widely referenced by regulators |
| DO-178C (Software in airborne systems) | Canonical high-assurance software standard; deep ties to reliability, safety, verification rigor; provides rich examples for levels of criticality and traceability |
| ISO/IEC 29119 (Software testing) | Comprehensive testing processes/techniques; maps to testability, coverage, and evidence qualities; offers structure for test artifacts and metrics |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 (Software life cycle processes) | Foundational process model for software; broad coverage of engineering and management processes; anchors many quality attributes (maintainability, reliability) across the lifecycle |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 (Systems life cycle processes) | Systems-level counterpart to 12207; enables end-to-end traceability, integration, and validation; supports cross-domain qualities and stakeholder views |
| ISO/IEC 27002 (Information security controls) | Practical complement to ISO 27001 already covered; concrete control catalog that maps to many qualities (confidentiality, integrity, availability) and requirements patterns |


## Already done

|Standard|Why that|
|---|---|
| PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) | Industry-mandated; concrete, auditable control requirements; strong fit for real-world security, logging, and availability requirements; applicable to many web/app contexts |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 26514:2022 (User documentation for systems and software) | Sets quality criteria for documentation structure and content; better docs increase code and system understandability and reduce maintenance effort |
