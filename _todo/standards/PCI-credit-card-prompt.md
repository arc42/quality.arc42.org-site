## Instructions

I have already described several quality standards (e.g., ISO 25010, ISO 26262, ISO 27001). 
Please help me to also cover **PCI-DSS**.

The existing file `_standards/pci-dss.md` is just a placeholder and might contain erroneous information.
Please thoroughly search the web for reliable and accurate sources and summarize them into a concise, one-page overview (similar in structure and tone to the existing standard pages).

In addition, please provide a list of quality attributes that are addressed (directly or indirectly) by the **PCI-DSS** standard. Put these names into a new file named `_todo/PCI-DSS-attributes-gpt.md`.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Review Existing Content:** First, carefully review the existing `_standards/iso-25010.md` file to understand and mirror its structure, tone, and level of detail for the new page.
2.  **Research:** Fetch authoritative and trustworthy sources about **PCI-DSS** from the web.
3.  **Synthesize and Write:** Synthesize the gathered information into a concise one-page overview and create an output file  `_standards/pci-dss-gpt.md` file. Explain the differences to the original _standards/pci-dss.md.
4.  **Extract Attributes:** Create the `_todo/PCI-DSS-attributes-gpt.md` file containing the list of quality attributes used or mentioned in pci-dss.

Think hardâ€”the correctness of all facts and links provided is crucial and highly important. Ask for clarification if you need additional information.
