# ISO/IEC 25024:2015 Quality Attributes

This document lists quality attributes addressed by ISO/IEC 25024:2015 - Systems and software engineering — Measurement of data quality.

## Primary Data Quality Characteristics (Inherent)

### Core Data Quality Dimensions
- **accuracy** - Degree to which data correctly represents real-world entities or values
- **completeness** - Degree to which all required data is present without missing information
- **consistency** - Degree to which data is uniform and coherent across datasets and systems
- **credibility** - Degree to which data is regarded as true and believable by users
- **currentness** - Degree to which data is up-to-date for its context of use (related to timeliness)

## System-Dependent Data Quality Characteristics

### Accessibility and Availability
- **availability** - Degree to which data is accessible and retrievable when required
- **accessibility** - Degree to which data can be accessed through appropriate interfaces
- **recoverability** - Degree to which data can be restored after failure or corruption

### Data Protection and Integrity
- **integrity** - Degree to which data is protected from unauthorized modification
- **confidentiality** - Degree to which data is accessible only to authorized entities
- **compliance** - Degree to which data adheres to standards, regulations, and conventions

### Data Management Qualities
- **traceability** - Degree to which origin, processing history, and lineage can be tracked
- **precision** - Degree to which data values are exact with appropriate granularity
- **portability** - Degree to which data can be transferred between different systems
- **efficiency** - Resources consumed in relation to data quality achieved

## Related Quality Attributes

### Data Governance and Management
- **data-quality** - Overall measure of data fitness for use across all dimensions
- **data-governance** - Systematic management of data quality throughout lifecycle
- **data-integrity** - Ensuring accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data
- **auditability** - Ability to verify and validate data quality measures

### Operational Qualities
- **timeliness** - Data is available when needed for decision-making
- **reliability** - Consistent and dependable data quality over time
- **maintainability** - Ease of maintaining data quality standards
- **testability** - Ability to verify data quality through testing and validation

### Domain-Specific Applications
- **correctness** - Data correctly represents intended information
- **validity** - Data conforms to defined formats, ranges, and rules
- **uniqueness** - Absence of duplicate or redundant data entries
- **currency** - Temporal accuracy and up-to-dateness of data values

## Measurement Approach

### Quality Measurement Elements
- **quality-measures** - Quantifiable indicators for data quality characteristics
- **measurement-functions** - Defined algorithms for calculating quality metrics
- **quality-requirements** - Specified targets and thresholds for data quality

### Quality Management
- **monitoring** - Continuous tracking of data quality metrics
- **reporting** - Communication of data quality status to stakeholders
- **improvement** - Systematic enhancement of data quality levels
