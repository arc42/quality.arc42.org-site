# Minimal categories/tags for _standards

A compact, orthogonal set that covers the current standards collection. Assign 1â€“3 tags per standard.

| Tag | Short definition | Typical scope/examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| general | Broad quality/process standards not tied to a specific risk domain | ISO 25010, ISO 5055, ISO 26514 |
| safety | Functional safety where malfunctions can harm people/environment/assets | IEC 61508, ISO 26262, IEC 62304, DO-178C |
| security | Information/cyber security (CIA), security management and controls | ISO 27001, IEC 62443, NIST 800-53, ISO 15408, PCI-DSS |
| privacy | Personal data protection and privacy governance | GDPR-aligned, privacy controls; complements security |
| ai | AI/ML governance, risk, transparency across the AI lifecycle | ISO/IEC 42001, ISO/IEC 22989 |
| data | Data quality and measurement characteristics | ISO 25024 (data quality), ISO 25022 (measurement) |
| sector | Sector/vertical-specific interoperability or domain scope | HL7 (health), PCI-DSS (payments), MISRA C (automotive) |

Notes
- Minimal set chosen to cover existing entries: safety, security, privacy, ai, data, general, sector.
- Use sector in addition to other tags when a standard is specific to a regulated industry or interoperability profile.
- Consider later split (e.g., industrial-security) only if usage demands finer granularity.
