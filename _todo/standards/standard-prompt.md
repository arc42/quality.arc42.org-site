## Instructions

The quality standard relevant here (abbreviated by {{standard}}) is WCAG.

I have already described several quality standards (e.g., ISO 25010, ISO 26262, ISO 27001). Please help me to also cover **{{standard}}**,


Please thoroughly search the web for other reliable and accurate sources and summarize them into a concise, one-page overview (similar in structure and tone to the existing standard pages).

In addition, please provide a list of quality attributes that are addressed (directly or indirectly) by the **{{standard}}** standard. Put these names into a new file named `_todo/{{standard}}-attributes.md`.

**Workflow:**

1.  **New branch**: Create a new branch for the new standard.
2.  **Review Existing Content:** First, carefully review the existing `_standards/iso-25010.md` file to understand and mirror its structure, tone, and level of detail for the new page.
3.  **Research:** Fetch authoritative and trustworthy sources about **{{standard}}** from the web.
4.  **Synthesize and Write:** Synthesize the gathered information into a concise one-page overview in the file `_standards/{{standard}}.md` file accordingly.
5.  **Extract Attributes:**
6.  add a section with authoritative sources (and markdown-compatible links) for {{standard}}

Think hard—the correctness of all facts and links provided is crucial and highly important.
Ask for clarification if you need additional information.
