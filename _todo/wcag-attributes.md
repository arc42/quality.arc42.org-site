# Quality Attributes Addressed by WCAG 2.2

This document lists quality attributes that are directly or indirectly addressed by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 standard.

## Primary Quality Attributes

These attributes are the core focus of WCAG 2.2:

### Directly Addressed (Core Focus)

1. **Accessibility** - The fundamental focus of WCAG; systematic removal of barriers for people with disabilities
2. **Perceivability** - First POUR principle; ensuring information can be perceived through available senses
3. **Operability** - Second POUR principle; ensuring interface components can be operated by all users
4. **Understandability** - Third POUR principle; ensuring content and interface operation are comprehensible
5. **Robustness** - Fourth POUR principle; ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies
6. **Inclusivity** - Equal access regardless of disability, age, device, or context
7. **Interaction Capability** - Supporting multiple input methods and flexible interaction patterns

## Secondary Quality Attributes

These attributes are significantly enhanced or influenced by WCAG 2.2 compliance:

### Usability-Related

8. **Usability** - Enhanced through predictable behavior, clear navigation, error prevention
9. **User Experience** - Improved experience for all users, not just those with disabilities
10. **Learnability** - Predictable, consistent interfaces reduce learning curve
11. **Efficiency** - Clear navigation and interaction patterns improve task completion
12. **User Satisfaction** - Accessible, usable interfaces increase satisfaction

### Design and Interface

13. **Consistency** - Required for navigation, identification, and behavior across pages
14. **Predictability** - Pages must appear and operate in predictable ways
15. **Readability** - Text must be readable and understandable
16. **Visibility** - Sufficient contrast, focus indicators, and distinguishable elements
17. **Clarity** - Clear labels, instructions, and error messages

### Interaction and Control

18. **Navigability** - Multiple ways to navigate; clear location indicators
19. **Controllability** - User control over timing, motion, and updates
20. **Flexibility** - Multiple ways to accomplish tasks; adaptable to user needs
21. **Configurability** - Content adapts to user preferences and assistive technologies
22. **Responsiveness** - Adapts to different screen sizes, orientations, and zoom levels

### Error Handling

23. **Error Prevention** - Input validation and confirmation for critical actions
24. **Error Tolerance** - Users can avoid and correct mistakes
25. **Recoverability** - Error identification with suggestions for correction
26. **Fault Tolerance** - Graceful handling of user errors and edge cases

### Content Quality

27. **Correctness** - Proper use of semantic markup and valid code
28. **Completeness** - Alternative content for non-text media
29. **Appropriateness** - Content appropriate for purpose and audience
30. **Timeliness** - Sufficient time for users to complete tasks

### Technical Quality

31. **Compatibility** - Works across browsers, devices, and assistive technologies
32. **Interoperability** - Standard markup enables integration with assistive technologies
33. **Maintainability** - Semantic, well-structured code easier to maintain
34. **Testability** - Testable success criteria enable verification
35. **Verifiability** - Can be verified through automated and manual testing

### Compliance and Governance

36. **Compliance** - Foundation for legal accessibility compliance worldwide
37. **Accountability** - Demonstrable conformance to standards
38. **Auditability** - Can be audited for conformance
39. **Transparency** - Clear, understandable privacy and accessibility statements

### Broader Impact

40. **Equity** - Equal access to information and functionality
41. **Social Responsibility** - Commitment to inclusive design
42. **Sustainability** - Accessible design often leads to cleaner, more efficient code
43. **Adaptability** - Content adapts to different contexts and technologies
44. **Universality** - Design for the widest possible range of users

## Mapping to ISO 25010 Characteristics

WCAG 2.2 primarily addresses the following ISO 25010 quality characteristics:

1. **Interaction Capability** (formerly Usability)
   - User interface aesthetics
   - Accessibility
   - Learnability
   - User error protection
   - User engagement

2. **Functional Suitability**
   - Functional completeness (alternative content)
   - Functional correctness

3. **Compatibility**
   - Co-existence (with assistive technologies)
   - Interoperability

4. **Reliability**
   - Fault tolerance
   - Recoverability

5. **Maintainability**
   - Modularity (semantic structure)
   - Modifiability
   - Testability

## Notes on Indirect Benefits

WCAG compliance often leads to improvements in attributes beyond accessibility:

- **Performance**: Semantic HTML and efficient markup improve page load times
- **SEO**: Accessible markup improves search engine optimization
- **Mobile-first**: Many accessibility practices align with mobile best practices
- **Future-proof**: Standards-compliant, semantic markup adapts better to new technologies
- **Code Quality**: Accessible code tends to be cleaner, more maintainable
- **User Reach**: Accessible sites reach broader audiences including:
  - Older users with age-related limitations
  - Users in situational limitations (bright sunlight, noisy environments)
  - Users with temporary disabilities (broken arm, eye surgery)
  - Users with slow internet connections (alt text loads before images)

## Implementation Priority

When implementing WCAG 2.2, the following quality attributes should be prioritized:

**Phase 1 - Critical (Level A)**
1. Accessibility (core)
2. Perceivability
3. Operability
4. Compliance (legal requirements)

**Phase 2 - Standard (Level AA)**
5. Understandability
6. Usability
7. Interaction Capability
8. Consistency
9. Error Prevention

**Phase 3 - Enhanced (Level AAA)**
10. User Experience
11. Inclusivity (maximum)
12. All other secondary attributes
