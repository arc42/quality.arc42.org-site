## Instructions

The quality standard relevant here (abbreviated by {{standard}}) is  "IEC 62443", especially parts 3-2, -4-1, and -4-2.

I have already described several quality standards (e.g., ISO 25010, ISO 26262, ISO 27001). Please help me to also cover **{{standard}}**,

Please thoroughly search the web for other reliable and accurate sources and summarize them into a concise, one-page overview (similar in structure and tone to the existing standard pages).

In addition, please provide a list of quality attributes that are addressed (directly or indirectly) by the **{{standard}}** standard. Put these names into a new file named `_todo/{{standard}}-attributes.md`.

Add a section "Quality Attributes" to the new file `_standards/{{standard}}.md` file, like its done in my other standards descriptions.

**Workflow:**
0.  **create a new branch** to work on, named after the standard
1.  **Review Existing Content:** First, carefully review the existing `_standards/iso-25010.md` file to understand and mirror its structure, tone, and level of detail for the new page.
2.  **Research:** Fetch authoritative and trustworthy sources about **{{standard}}** from the web.
3.  **Synthesize and Write:** Synthesize the gathered information into a concise one-page overview in the file `_standards/{{standard}}.md` file accordingly.
4.  **Extract Attributes:**
5.  add a section with authoritative sources (and markdown-compatible links) for {{standard}}

Think hardâ€”the correctness of all facts and links provided is crucial and highly important.
Ask for clarification if you need additional information.
