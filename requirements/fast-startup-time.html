  <p><strong>Background</strong>: Imagine a mobile phone or a navigation system in your car. 
Such systems are sometimes in <em>power-off</em> state (aka turned-off).
When users power-on (turn on, power-up, start) the system, they want them to be operational (aka usable) in a relatively short time.</p>

  <p>This also holds for systems that are automatically managed, e.g. services deployed in the cloud.</p>

  <p><strong>Metric</strong>: The system must be able to start from <em>power-off</em> to <em>operational</em> state in less than 90 seconds.</p>
