  <p><strong>Background</strong>: The system offers storage capacity for user-files, similar to services like Dropbox or OneDrive.</p>

  <p><strong>Scenario</strong>: The system has zero knowledge of the content of user files. 
This means that neither the system nor its admins own the encryption keys of user files and therefore canâ€™t access them.</p>

  <p>It implies that if a user loses the encryption key, data <strong>cannot be recovered</strong>.</p>
