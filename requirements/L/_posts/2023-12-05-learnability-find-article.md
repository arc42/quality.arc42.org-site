**Scenario**: A user who has never used the system before, but other IT systems in general

**Stimulus**: has to find a specific article.

**Reaction**: The system's search page displays the article as a search result if asked for it.

**Metric**: 95% of the users find the search page and then the article in less than two minutes.

**Background**: The navigation and search page must be built in a way that users who use other IT-systems learn the usage of the given system without having to read a manual or the need to ask someone.
