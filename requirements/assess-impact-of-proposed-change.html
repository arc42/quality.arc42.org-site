  <h4 id="contextbackground">Context/Background</h4>

  <p>The system is a financial software application with multiple modules.
A software development team needs to analyze and assess the impact of a proposed change to a specific module.
The system’s analysability is crucial for efficient change management and maintenance.
Tools and practices are in place to support code documentation, dependency mapping, and change simulation.</p>

  <h4 id="source">Source</h4>

  <p>A software development team initiates an impact analysis for a proposed change to a specific module of the financial software application.</p>

  <h4 id="metricacceptance-criteria">Metric/Acceptance Criteria</h4>

  <p>The system’s analysability requirement will be considered met when the following precise metrics are achieved:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Change Impact Assessment Time:
      <ul>
        <li>The team must be able to assess the impact of the proposed change within 2 hours</li>
        <li>This time starts from the moment the team begins reviewing relevant documentation and source code</li>
        <li>The assessment should cover all potential areas affected by the change</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Code Comment Density:
      <ul>
        <li>The affected module must have a minimum code comment density of 20%</li>
        <li>This density should be measured using automated code analysis tools</li>
        <li>Comments should be meaningful and provide clear explanations of code functionality</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Dependency Mapping:
      <ul>
        <li>The system must provide a visual dependency map of the module, that indicates all dependencies on and from other components</li>
        <li>Generation time for the dependency map must not exceed 5 minutes</li>
        <li>The map should be accurate, showing 100% of actual dependencies</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Overall Compliance:
      <ul>
        <li>All three criteria (assessment time, comment density, and dependency mapping) must be met for the requirement to be satisfied</li>
        <li>Compliance should be verified through at least 3 different change scenarios</li>
        <li>Any failures in meeting these criteria should be documented and addressed</li>
        <li>The system should maintain this level of analysability for at least 90% of all modules</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
