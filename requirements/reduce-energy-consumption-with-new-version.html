<div class="quality-requirement">
  <p><strong>Stimulus</strong>: The software system is in operation, serving a high number of concurrent users in a data center powered by non-renewable energy sources.</p>

  <p><strong>Environment</strong>: High demand for data processing and computational resources, typical of a large-scale application.</p>

  <p><strong>Response</strong>: The system should prioritize energy efficiency and carbon reduction in its operations. 
It should be designed to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>optimize energy consumption, aiming to reduce overall energy usage by 25% compared to the previous yearâ€™s energy consumption.</li>
    <li>incorporate renewable energy sources for its data center operations, striving to achieve at least 50% of renewable energy usage within the next two years.</li>
    <li>achieve at least 50% of renewable energy usage within the next two years. This goal promotes a gradual shift towards more sustainable energy practices.</li>
  </ul>
