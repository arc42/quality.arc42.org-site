  <p><strong>Scenario</strong>: The vehicle’s position on the map of the navigation system</p>

  <p><strong>Stimulus</strong>: is updated.</p>

  <p><strong>Reaction</strong>: The current position of the vehicle is determined by extrapolation and not GPS data.</p>

  <p><strong>Metric</strong>: The extrapolated position is recalculated with a frequency greater than 10Hz.</p>

  <p><strong>Background</strong>: The GPS position retrieval rate via satellite might be insufficient low, such that in-between positions are determined using extrapolation.</p>

  <h4 id="contextbackground">Context/Background</h4>

  <p>The system is a vehicle navigation system that displays the vehicle’s position on a map.
GPS data might be retrieved at an insufficient rate for smooth position updates.
To compensate for this, the system uses extrapolation to determine in-between positions.
This extrapolation is crucial for providing a smooth and accurate representation of the vehicle’s movement on the map.</p>

  <h4 id="source">Source</h4>

  <p>The vehicle’s position on the map of the navigation system is being updated.
The current position is determined by extrapolation rather than direct GPS data.</p>

  <h4 id="metricacceptance-criteria">Metric/Acceptance Criteria</h4>

  <p>The extrapolated position of the vehicle must be recalculated with a frequency greater than 10Hz.</p>

  <p>This requirement will be considered met when:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The system consistently maintains a position update rate higher than 10 times per second</li>
    <li>This update rate is maintained under various driving conditions (e.g., different speeds, urban vs. rural environments)</li>
    <li>The transition between extrapolated positions and new GPS data is smooth, with no visible jumps on the map</li>
  </ul>
