  <p><strong>Stimulus</strong>: 
A new release of an authentication/authorization service (which our product uses) is made available in the component marketplace, and the product owner decides to incorporate this version into the release.</p>

  <p><strong>Response</strong>: The new service is tested and deployed to the production environment.</p>

  <p><strong>Measure</strong>: 
It takes less than 40 hours of elapsed time and no more than 120 person-hours of effort. 
The deployment introduces no defects and no SLA is violated.</p>
