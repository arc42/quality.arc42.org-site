#### Context/Background

The system operates in an environment where document integrity and trustworthiness are critical.
It provides functionality for users to verify the authenticity of digital documents.
The system employs a robust digital signature mechanism to ensure document authenticity and integrity.
A secure and tamper-proof audit trail is maintained for all document-related activities.

#### Source

A user attempts to verify the authenticity of a digital document.

#### Metric/Acceptance Criteria

The system must provide a robust digital signature mechanism and maintain a secure audit trail.
The authenticity verification process must meet the following criteria:
* Digital signature mechanism correctly verifies the authenticity and integrity of 100% of unmodified documents
* Any modifications or tampering to a document are detected with 100% accuracy
* The audit trail records all document-related activities, including creation, modifications, and approvals
* Each audit trail entry includes accurate timestamps and user identifiers
* The audit trail is tamper-proof, with any attempts at unauthorized modification being detected and logged
* Digital signature verification process completes within 5 seconds for documents up to 10MB in size
* Audit trail entries are created and logged within 1 second of the corresponding document activity
* The system provides a clear, user-friendly interface for users to initiate and understand the results of the authenticity verification process
* The audit trail is searchable, allowing authorized users to retrieve the complete history of a document within 30 seconds
* The system maintains 99.99% uptime for the authenticity verification service
