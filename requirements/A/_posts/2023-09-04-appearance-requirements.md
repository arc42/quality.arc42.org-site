<div class="quality-requirement" markdown="1">

#### Context/Background

The system is a mobile application with a user interface (UI) for performing common tasks such as creating an account or making a purchase.
The appearance of the UI is critical for user experience and brand consistency.
The application needs to maintain visual consistency, color scheme compliance, text legibility, proper image resolution, responsive design, and acceptable loading times across various devices and screen sizes.
The UI should adhere to accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.0.

#### Source

A user interacts with a mobile application's user interface (UI) to perform a common task, such as creating an account or making a purchase.

#### Metric/Acceptance Criteria

The appearance requirement will be considered met when the following precise metrics are achieved:

* Visual Consistency:
  * At least 95% of UI elements must adhere to the established style guide
  * This adherence should be visually assessed and documented

* Color Scheme Compliance:
  * No more than 5% deviation from the specified color codes is allowed
  * Compliance should be verified using automated color analysis tools

* Text Legibility:
  * 100% of text elements must meet WCAG 2.0 accessibility guidelines
  * Font size, contrast ratios, and line spacing should be compliant
  * Automated accessibility testing tools should confirm this compliance

* Image Resolution:
  * 100% of images and icons must be rendered without distortion or pixelation
  * Automated testing should verify correct resolution and aspect ratio

* Responsive Design:
  * UI layout must remain visually appealing and functional on at least 95% of tested devices
  * Testing should cover multiple devices and screen sizes
  * No critical layout issues should be observed in these tests

* Loading Times:
  * No individual UI element should exceed a 3-second loading time
  * Automated performance testing should validate this requirement
  * Specific loading time targets should be defined for each major UI element (e.g., main screen, product images)

* Overall Compliance:
  * The application must pass all the above criteria in at least 3 consecutive testing cycles
  * Any failures must be documented, addressed, and re-tested until compliance is achieved
