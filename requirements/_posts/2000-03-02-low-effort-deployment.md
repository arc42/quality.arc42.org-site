**Stimulus**: 
A new release of an authentication/authorization service (which our product uses) is made available in the component marketplace and the product owner decides to incorporate this version into the release. 

**Response**: The new service is tested and deployed to the production environment. 


**Measure**: 
It takes less than 40 hours of elapsed time and no more than 120 person-hours of effort. 
The deployment introduces no defects and no SLA is violated.
