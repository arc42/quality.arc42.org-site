The system must be able to start from _power-off_ to _operational_ state in less than 90 seconds.


**Background**: Imagine a mobile phone or a navigation system in your car. 
Such systems are sometimes in _power-off_ state (aka turned-off).
When users power-on (turn on, power-up, start) the system, they want them to be operational (aka usable) in a relatively short time.
