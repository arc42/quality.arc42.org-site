### Context/Background

* The system's energy is supplied by a rechargeable onboard battery provided by an external supplier that is mechanically attached to a circuit board.
* The current version of that board fits only batteries of ONE specific supplier.

### Source

Product management has decided to reduce dependency of this specific supplier and to modify the circuit board.

### Metric/Acceptance Criteria

* The circuit board (thus the system) shall be compatible with battery models from the five preferred battery suppliers.
* The system shall successfully operate with battery models from all these five suppliers without requiring any hardware modifications.
* The system shall pass functional tests with each battery model under standard operating conditions.
* The system's performance, especially battery life, shall vary by less than 10% across the different battery models.
