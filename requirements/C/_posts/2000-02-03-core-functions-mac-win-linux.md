#### Context/Background

* The system offers a few complicated core business functions.
* The system is available on different operating systems, especially macOS, Windows and a few major Linux distributions.
  
#### Source

* A new release of one of the supported operating (OS) systems becomes available. 

#### Metric/Acceptance Criteria

* The new release of the OS does not affect the ability to work on this platform, 
 at least in comparable execution environments (concerning cpu and memory capacity).
 
* Core functions can be re-used on macOS, Windows and Linux applications without changes to their source code.
