  <p><strong>Context</strong>: The system monitors patients several health and vitality parameters (e.g. heartbeat frequency and amplitude, blood flow in coronary artery etc)</p>

  <p><strong>Stimulus</strong>: A sensor in the patient monitoring system fails to report a life-critical value after 100 ms.</p>

  <p><strong>Reaction</strong>: 
The failure is logged, a warning light is illuminated on the console, and a backup (lower-fidelity) sensor is engaged.</p>

  <p><strong>Metric</strong>: 
The system monitors the patient using the backup sensor after no more than 300 ms.</p>
