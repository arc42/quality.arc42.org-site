<div class="quality-requirement">

  <p><strong>Stimulus</strong>: User has (accidentally) started a report generation, but now wants to interrupt and clicks the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">abort</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cancel</code> button or select the cancel-function via keyboard.</p>

  <p><strong>Reaction</strong>: The system interrupts the report generation, saves the current generation state (in case user wants to continue later) and returns control to the user interface.</p>

  <p><strong>Metric</strong>: User gets back full keyboard or mouse control within at most 10 seconds. That means that all backend generation tasks or processes have acknowledged the abort/cancel signal.</p>

  <p><strong>Background</strong>: The generation of such reports is performed in several parallel threads or processes, eventually on different OS-processes, virtual machines or containers. Cancelling or aborting needs to handle such kind of distributed execution.</p>
