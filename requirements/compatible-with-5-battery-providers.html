  <ul>
    <li>The system’s energy is supplied by a rechargeable onboard battery provided by an external supplier that is mechanically attached to a circuit board.</li>
    <li>The current version of that board fits only batteries of ONE specific supplier.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="source">Source</h3>

  <p>Product management has decided to reduce dependency of this specific supplier and to modify the circuit board.</p>

  <h3 id="metricacceptance-criteria">Metric/Acceptance Criteria</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The circuit board (thus the system) shall be compatible with battery models from the five preferred battery suppliers.</li>
    <li>The system shall successfully operate with battery models from all these five suppliers without requiring any hardware modifications.</li>
    <li>The system shall pass functional tests with each battery model under standard operating conditions.</li>
    <li>The system’s performance, especially battery life, shall vary by less than 10% across the different battery models.</li>
  </ul>
