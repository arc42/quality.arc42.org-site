<div class="quality-requirement">

  <p><strong>Stimulus</strong>: A user selects a graphical filter (like shadow, greyscaling, resizing or similar) and clicks or selects the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apply filter</code> function.</p>

  <p><strong>Reaction</strong>: The system displays the changed image next to the original upon.</p>

  <p><strong>Metric</strong>: The system displays the changed image in less than a second.</p>

  <p><strong>Background</strong>: We develop an image manipulation software, offering a variety of image filters for users to select and apply to their images. Such filters include shadows, greyscaling, resizing, background-removal and others.</p>

  <p>To achieve the required response time, itâ€™s an option to reduce the resolution of the image for the preview.</p>
