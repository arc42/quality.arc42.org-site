<div class="quality-requirement">

  <ul>
    <li>Query diagnosis must not add more than 1% or 2msec runtime overhead to the queries, whichever is larger. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>a query which takes 200msec to complete must not take more than 202msec with diagnosis,</li>
        <li>a 100msec query not more than 102msec.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Query diagnosis must not add more than 1MB memory footprint to system execution.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Background</strong>: We execute a large number of CPU- and memory-intensive database queries within our system. 
A diagnostic component can measure the execution time of these queries, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">query-diagnosis</code> configuration is turned on.</p>
