  <p>The user accesses the web application in a standard web browser, using the latest version of a popular screen reader.</p>

  <h3 id="response-measure">Response Measure</h3>

  <p><strong>Navigation</strong>: At least 95% of all interactive elements (e.g., links, buttons, form fields) should be navigable and identifiable using the screen reader.</p>

  <p><strong>Content</strong>: At least 98% of all content, including text, images (with alt attributes), videos (with captions), etc., should be accessible and consumable using the screen reader.</p>

  <p><strong>Interactivity</strong>: Users should be able to interact with 95% of web application’s functionality, such as submitting forms, without encountering any accessibility barriers.</p>

  <p><strong>Feedback</strong>: All messages, errors, and notifications should be clearly announced to the screen reader with 99% accuracy.</p>

  <p><strong>Load time</strong>: Despite any accessibility enhancements, page load times should not exceed 3 seconds for 90% of page loads, ensuring that the accessibility features don’t negatively impact performance.</p>

  <p><strong>Compliance</strong>: The application should meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1</a> Level AA standard criteria. 
Automated testing tools should report zero non-compliance issues, and manual testing should identify no more than 2 issues per page.</p>
