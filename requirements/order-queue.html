<div class="quality-requirement">

  <p><strong>Background</strong>: The database is down, so orders received from the shop cannot be processed immediately</p>

  <p><strong>Source</strong>: User</p>

  <p><strong>Stimulus</strong>: Sends an order to the shop</p>

  <p><strong>Reaction</strong>: The system detects the database is down and queues the order for 1 day. As soon as the database is back up, the queued orders are processed</p>
