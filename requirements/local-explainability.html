  <p><strong>Stimulus</strong>: The user was subject of a decision of the system.</p>

  <p><strong>Environment</strong>: The user has submitted a request and the system used Artificial Intelligence (AI) to decide if the request should be approved or not. The user is then informed of the decision.</p>

  <p><strong>Response</strong>: The user is informed about the 3 features that were most influential in the final decision.</p>

  <p><strong>Background</strong>: Using AI to generate decisions involves finding patterns in large sets of data. Individual results are subject to statistical noise and may be erroneous. Specifically for systems in high risk scenarios, giving users an explanation is necessary to allow additional oversight and appeal processes.</p>
