  <p><strong>Background</strong>: Prior to using the system, users must authenticate themselves, either by using SSO or entering unique credentials (username/password).</p>

  <p>After authentication, the system determines this usersâ€™ authorization level (which function these users are allowed to use and which data they are allowed to see and/or modify)</p>

  <p><strong>Scenario</strong>: Users are allowed to use only those system functions and see only the data they are authorized for.</p>
