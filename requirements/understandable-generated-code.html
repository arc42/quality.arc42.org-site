  <p><strong>Stimulus</strong>: A developer has created a new test case in xml.</p>

  <p><strong>Reaction</strong>: The code generator creates a source code file.</p>

  <p><strong>Metric</strong>: A human tester can understand the generated test and enhance it with additional tests or test-data within max 30 minutes.</p>

  <p><strong>Background</strong>: Test cases for a system are described in a (semi-)formal xml-based language and automatically converted into Java, Kotlin or Groovy source code. This code is later adjusted or enhanced by developers or testers.</p>
