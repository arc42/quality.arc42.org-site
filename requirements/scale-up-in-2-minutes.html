<div class="quality-requirement">

  <p><strong>Background</strong>: A cloud-based web application, with a sudden increase in user traffic, such as during a promotional event or a major product launch. 
Auto-scaling features are available and configured.</p>

  <p><strong>Response</strong>: The system automatically detects the increase in load and provisions additional resources to handle the increased traffic, without human intervention.</p>

  <p><strong>Metric</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Time to Scale: The system should begin scaling up additional resources within 2 minutes of detecting a 50% increase in traffic load.</li>
    <li>Resource Utilization: After scaling, CPU and memory utilization should stabilize at approximately 70%, ensuring that resources are neither underutilized (wasteful) nor overburdened (which could degrade performance).</li>
    <li>Performance Maintenance: The response time of the web application should not exceed 3 seconds for 95% of the requests, even during peak traffic.
Cost Efficiency: The cost of scaled resources should not exceed a 150% increase despite a 200% increase in traffic, emphasizing cost-effective scaling.</li>
  </ul>
