  <h3 id="stimulus">Stimulus</h3>
  <p>A software development team deploys a new version of a web application to a production environment.</p>

  <h3 id="response">Response</h3>
  <p>The change failure rate requirement will be considered met when the following precise metrics are achieved over a three-month period:</p>

  <p><strong>Successful Deployments</strong>: The percentage of successful deployments, where all changes are rolled out without causing production incidents, should be at least 98%.</p>

  <p><strong>Severe Incidents</strong>: The number of severe incidents directly caused by deployments (e.g., application crashes, data loss) should not exceed 1 per month on average.</p>

  <p><strong>Minor Incidents</strong>: The number of minor incidents (e.g., non-critical bugs, minor performance issues) directly caused by deployments should not exceed 2 per month on average.</p>

  <p><strong>Rollback Rate</strong>: The rate of rollbacks due to deployment issues should not exceed 2% of all deployments.</p>

  <p><strong>Incident Resolution Time</strong>: The average time to resolve deployment-related incidents should not exceed 4 hours for severe incidents and 2 hours for minor incidents.</p>

  <p><strong>Customer Complaints</strong>: The number of customer complaints related to degraded service or issues caused by deployments should not exceed 1 per month on average.</p>
